<h2>AL-FATIHAH</h2>
</div>
<p>In the Khedivial Library of Cairo, among the Papyri
of the Scribe of Amen-Ra and the beautifully
illuminated copies of the Kor&acirc;n, the modern Arabic
Manuscript which forms the subject of this Book, was
found. The present Editor was attracted to it by the
dedication and the rough drawings on the cover; which,
indeed, are as curious, if not as mystical, as ancient
Egyptian symbols. One of these is supposed to represent
a New York Skyscraper in the shape of a Pyramid,
the other is a dancing group under which is written:
&#8220;The Stockbrokers and the Dervishes.&#8221; And around
these symbols, in Arabic circlewise, these words:&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;<i>And
this is my Book, the Book of Khalid, which I
dedicate to my Brother Man, my Mother Nature, and
my Maker God.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Needless to say we asked at once the Custodian of the
Library to give us access to this Book of Khalid, and
after examining it, we hired an amanuensis to make a
copy for us. Which copy we subsequently used as the
warp of our material; the woof we shall speak of in
the following chapter. No, there is nothing in
this Work which we can call ours, except it be the
Loom. But the weaving, we assure the Reader, was
a mortal process; for the material is of such a mixture
that here and there the raw silk of Syria is often spun
with the cotton and wool of America. In other words,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vi' name='page_vi'></a>vi</span>
the Author dips his antique pen in a modern inkstand,
and when the ink runs thick, he mixes it with a slabbering
of slang. But we started to write an Introduction,
not a Criticism. And lest we end by writing
neither, we give here what is more to the point than
anything we can say: namely, Al-Fatihah, or the Opening
Word of Khalid himself.</p>
<p>With supreme indifference to the classic Arabic
proem, he begins by saying that his Book is neither
a Memoir nor an Autobiography, neither a Journal nor
a Confession.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orientals,&#8221; says he, &#8220;seldom adventure into that
region of fancy and fabrication so alluring to European
and American writers; for, like the eyes of huris, our
vanity is soft and demure. This then is a book of
travels in an impalpable country, an enchanted country,
from which we have all risen, and towards which we
are still rising. It is, as it were, the chart and history
of one little kingdom of the Soul,&ndash;&ndash;the Soul of a philosopher,
poet and criminal. I am all three, I swear,
for I have lived both the wild and the social life. And
I have thirsted in the desert, and I have thirsted in the
city: the springs of the former were dry; the water
in the latter was frozen in the pipes. That is why, to
save my life, I had to be an incendiary at times, and
at others a footpad. And whether on the streets of
knowledge, or in the open courts of love, or in the
parks of freedom, or in the cellars and garrets of
thought and devotion, the only <i>saki</i> that would give
me a drink without the asking was he who called himself
Patience....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vii' name='page_vii'></a>vii</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And so, the Book of Khalid was written. It is
the only one I wrote in this world, having made, as
I said, a brief sojourn in its civilised parts. I leave
it now where I wrote it, and I hope to write other
books in other worlds. Now understand, Allah keep
and guide thee, I do not leave it here merely as a certificate
of birth or death. I do not raise it up as an epitaph,
a trade-sign, or any other emblem of vainglory or
lucre; but truly as a propylon through which my race
and those above and below my race, are invited to pass
to that higher Temple of mind and spirit. For we are
all tourists, in a certain sense, and this world is the
most ancient of monuments. We go through life as
those pugreed-solar-hatted-Europeans go through
Egypt. We are pestered and plagued with guides and
dragomans of every rank and shade;&ndash;&ndash;social and political
guides, moral and religious dragomans: a Tolstoy
here, an Ibsen there, a Spencer above, a Nietzche below.
And there thou art left in perpetual confusion
and despair. Where wilt thou go? Whom wilt thou
follow?</p>
<p>&#8220;Or wilt thou tarry to see the work of redemption
accomplished? For Society must be redeemed, and
many are the redeemers. The Cross, however, is out
of fashion, and so is the Dona Dulcinea motive. Howbeit,
what an array of Masters and Knights have we,
and what a variety! The work can be done, and
speedily, if we could but choose. Wagner can do it
with music; Bakunin, with dynamite; Karl Marx,
with the levelling rod; Haeckel, with an injection
of protoplasmic logic; the Pope, with a pinch of salt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
and chrism; and the Packer-Kings of America, with
pork and beef. What wilt thou have? Whom wilt
thou employ? Many are the applicants, many are
the guides. But if they are all going the way of
Juhannam, the Beef-packer I would choose. For verily,
a gobbet of beef on the way were better than
canned protoplasmic logic or bottled salt and
chrism....</p>
<p>&#8220;No; travel not on a Cook&#8217;s ticket; avoid the guides.
Take up thy staff and foot it slowly and leisurely;
tarry wherever thy heart would tarry. There is no
need of hurrying, O my Brother, whether eternal
Juhannam or eternal Jannat await us yonder. Come;
if thou hast not a staff, I have two. And what I
have in my Scrip I will share with thee. But turn
thy back to the guides; for verily we see more of them
than of the ruins and monuments. Verily, we get
more of the Dragomans than of the Show. Why then
continue to move and remove at their command?&ndash;&ndash;Take
thy guidebook in hand and I will tell thee what
is in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the time will come, I tell thee, when every
one will be his own guide and dragoman. The
time will come when it will not be necessary to write
books for others, or to legislate for others, or to make
religions for others: the time will come when every
one will write his own Book in the Life he lives, and
that Book will be his code and his creed;&ndash;&ndash;that Life-Book
will be the palace and cathedral of his Soul in
all the Worlds.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>No matter how good thou art, O my Brother,
or how bad thou art, no matter how high or how
low in the scale of being thou art, I still would believe
in thee, and have faith in thee, and love thee.
For do I not know what clings to thee, and what
beckons to thee? The claws of the one and the wings
of the other, have I not felt and seen? Look up,
therefore, and behold this World-Temple, which, to
us, shall be a resting-place, and not a goal. On the
border-line of the Orient and Occident it is built, on
the mountain-heights overlooking both. No false gods
are worshipped in it,&ndash;&ndash;no philosophic, theologic, or
anthropomorphic gods. Yea, and the god of the
priests and prophets is buried beneath the Fountain,
which is the altar of the Temple, and from which
flows the eternal spirit of our Maker&ndash;&ndash;our Maker
who blinketh when the Claws are deep in our flesh,
and smileth when the Wings spring from our Wounds.
Verily, we are the children of the God of Humour,
and the Fountain in His Temple is ever flowing.
Tarry, and refresh thyself, O my Brother, tarry, and
refresh thyself.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>PROBING THE TRIVIAL</h3>
</div>
<p>The most important in the history of nations and
individuals was once the most trivial, and vice
versa. The plebeian, who is called to-day the man-in-the-street,
can never see and understand the significance
of the hidden seed of things, which in time
must develop or die. A garter dropt in the ballroom
of Royalty gives birth to an Order of Knighthood;
a movement to reform the spelling of the English
language, initiated by one of the presidents of a great
Republic, becomes eventually an object of ridicule.
Only two instances to illustrate our point, which is
applicable also to time-honoured truths and moralities.
But no matter how important or trivial these, he who
would give utterance to them must do so in cap and
bells, if he would be heard nowadays. Indeed, the
play is always the thing; the frivolous is the most
essential, if only as a disguise.&ndash;&ndash;For look you, are
we not too prosperous to consider seriously your ponderous
preachment? And when you bring it to us
in book form, do you expect us to take it into our
homes and take you into our hearts to boot?&ndash;&ndash;Which
argument is convincing even to the man in the barn.</p>
<p>But the Author of the Khedivial Library Manuscript
can make his Genius dance the dance of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
seven veils, if you but knew. It is to be regretted,
however, that he has not mastered the most subtle of
arts, the art of writing about one&#8217;s self. He seldom
brushes his wings against the dust or lingers among
the humble flowers close to the dust: he does not
follow the masters in their entertaining trivialities and
fatuities. We remember that even Gibbon interrupts
the turgid flow of his spirit to tell us in his Autobiography
that he really could, and often did, enjoy
a game of cards in the evening. And Rousseau, in
a suppurative passion, whispers to us in his Confessions
that he even kissed the linen of Madame de Warens&#8217;
bed when he was alone in her room. And Spencer
devotes whole pages in his dull and ponderous history
of himself to narrate the all-important narration of
his constant indisposition,&ndash;&ndash;to assure us that his ill
health more than once threatened the mighty task he
had in hand. These, to be sure, are most important
revelations. But Khalid here misses his cue. Inspiration
does not seem to come to him in firefly-fashion.</p>
<p>He would have done well, indeed, had he studied
the method of the professional writers of Memoirs,
especially those of France. For might he not then
have discoursed delectably on The Romance of my
Stick Pin, The Tragedy of my Sombrero, The Scandal
of my Red Flannel, The Conquest of my Silk Socks,
The Adventures of my Tuxedo, and such like? But
Khalid is modest only in the things that pertain to the
outward self. He wrote of other Romances and other
Tragedies. And when his Genius is not dancing the
dance of the seven veils, she is either flirting with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
monks of the Lebanon hills or setting fire to something
in New York. But this is not altogether satisfactory
to the present Editor, who, unlike the Author of the
Khedivial Library MS., must keep the reader in mind.
&#8217;Tis very well to endeavour to unfold a few of the mysteries
of one&#8217;s palingenesis, but why conceal from us his
origin? For is it not important, is it not the fashion
at least, that one writing his own history should first
expatiate on the humble origin of his ancestors and the
distant obscure source of his genius? And having
done this, should he not then tell us how he behaved
in his boyhood; whether or not he made anklets of
his mother&#8217;s dough for his little sister; whether he did
not kindle the fire with his father&#8217;s Kor&acirc;n; whether
he did not walk under the rainbow and try to reach
the end of it on the hill-top; and whether he did not
write verse when he was but five years of age. About
these essentialities Khalid is silent. We only know
from him that he is a descendant of the brave sea-daring
Ph&oelig;nicians&ndash;&ndash;a title which might be claimed with
justice even by the aborigines of Yucatan&ndash;&ndash;and that
he was born in the city of Baalbek, in the shadow of
the great Heliopolis, a little way from the mountain-road
to the Cedars of Lebanon. All else in this direction
is obscure.</p>
<p>And the K. L. MS. which we kept under our pillow
for thirteen days and nights, was beginning to
worry us. After all, might it not be a literary hoax,
we thought, and might not this Khalid be a myth.
And yet, he does not seem to have sought any material
or worldly good from the writing of his Book.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Why, then, should he resort to deception? Still, we
doubted. And one evening we were detained by the
sandomancer, or sand-diviner, who was sitting cross-legged
on the sidewalk in front of the mosque. &#8220;I
know your mind,&#8221; said he, before we had made up our
mind to consult him. And mumbling his &#8220;abracadabra&#8221;
over the sand spread on a cloth before him,
he took up his bamboo-stick and wrote therein&ndash;&ndash;Khalid!
This was amazing. &#8220;And I know more,&#8221;
said he. But after scouring the heaven, he shook his
head regretfully and wrote in the sand the name of
one of the hasheesh-dens of Cairo. &#8220;Go thither; and
come to see me again to-morrow evening.&#8221; Saying
which, he folded his sand-book of magic, pocketed his
fee, and walked away.</p>
<p>In that hasheesh-den,&ndash;&ndash;the reekiest, dingiest of the
row in the Red Quarter,&ndash;&ndash;where the etiolated intellectualities
of Cairo flock after midnight, the name
of Khalid evokes much resounding wit, and sarcasm,
and laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the new Muhdi,&#8221; said one, offering us
his chobok of hasheesh; &#8220;smoke to his health and prosperity.
Ha, ha, ha.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the chorus of laughter, which is part and parcel
of a hasheesh jag, was tremendous. Every one thereupon
had something to say on the subject. The contagion
could not be checked. And Khalid was called
&#8220;the dervish of science&#8221; by one; &#8220;the rope-dancer
of nature&#8221; by another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Prophet lived in a cave in the wilderness
of New York for five years,&#8221; remarked a third.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And he sold his camel yesterday and bought a
bicycle instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Young Turks can not catch him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but wait till England gets after our new
Muhdi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till his new phthisic-stricken wife dies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom will our Prophet marry, if among all
the virgins of Egypt we can not find a consumptive
for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when he pulls down the pyramids to build
American Skyscrapers with their stones, where shall
we bury then our Muhdi?&#8221;</p>
<p>All of which, although mystifying to us, and depressing,
was none the less reassuring. For Khalid,
it seems, is not a myth. No; we can even see him,
we are told, and touch him, and hear him speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shakib the poet, his most intimate friend and
disciple, will bring you into the sacred presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can not miss him, for he is the drummer of
our new Muhdi, ha, ha, ha!&#8221;</p>
<p>And this Shakib was then suspended and stoned.
But their humour, like the odor and smoke of gunjah,
(hasheesh) was become stifling. So, we lay our chobok
down; and, thanking them for the entertainment,
we struggle through the rolling reek and fling to the
open air.</p>
<p>In the grill-room of the Mena House we meet the
poet Shakib, who was then drawing his inspiration
from a glass of whiskey and soda. Nay, he was
drowning his sorrows therein, for his Master, alas!
has mysteriously disappeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen him for ten days,&#8221; said the Poet;
&#8220;and I know not where he is.&ndash;&ndash;If I did? Ah, my
friend, you would not then see me here. Indeed, I
should be with him, and though he be in the trap of
the Young Turks.&#8221; And some real tears flowed
down the cheeks of the Poet, as he spoke.</p>
<p>The Mena House, a charming little Branch of Civilisation
at the gate of the desert, stands, like man himself,
in the shadow of two terrible immensities, the
Sphinx and the Pyramid, the Origin and the End.
And in the grill-room, over a glass of whiskey and soda,
we presume to solve in few words the eternal mystery.
But that is not what we came for. And to
avoid the bewildering depths into which we were led,
we suggested a stroll on the sands. Here the Poet
waxed more eloquent, and shed more tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our favourite haunt,&#8221; said he; &#8220;here is
where we ramble, here is where we loaf. And Khalid
once said to me, &#8216;In loafing here, I work as hard as
did the masons and hod-carriers who laboured on these
pyramids.&#8217; And I believe him. For is not a book
greater than a pyramid? Is not a mosque or a palace
better than a tomb? An object is great in proportion
to its power of resistance to time and the elements.
That is why we think the pyramids are great. But
see, the desert is greater than the pyramids, and the sea
is greater than the desert, and the heavens are greater
than the sea. And yet, there is not in all these that
immortal intelligence, that living, palpitating soul,
which you find in a great book. A man who conceives
and writes a great book, my friend, has done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
more work than all the helots that laboured on these
pyramidal futilities. That is why I find no exaggeration
in Khalid&#8217;s words. For when he loafs, he
does so in good earnest. Not like the camel-driver
there or the camel, but after the manner of the great
thinkers and mystics: like Al-Fared and Jelal&#8217;ud-Deen
Rumy, like Socrates and St. Francis of Assisi, Khalid
loafs. For can you escape being reproached for idleness
by merely working? Are you going to waste
your time and power in useless unproductive labour,
carrying dates to Hajar (or coals to Newcastle, which
is the English equivalent), that you might not be
called an idler, a loafer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed not,&#8221; we reply; &#8220;for the Poet taking in the
sea, or the woods, or the starry-night, the poet who
might be just sharing the sunshine with the salamander,
is as much a labourer as the stoker or the bricklayer.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with a few more such remarks, we showed our
friend that, not being of india-rubber, we could not
but expand under the heat of his grandiosity.</p>
<p>We then make our purpose known, and Shakib is
overjoyed. He offers to kiss us for the noble thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Europe should know Khalid better, and
only through you and me can this be done. For you
can not properly understand him, unless you read the
<i>Histoire Intime</i>, which I have just finished. That
will give you <i>les dessous de cartes</i> of his character.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Les <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'dessous'">dessons</ins></i>&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;and the Poet who intersperses
his Arabic with fancy French, explains.&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;The lining,
the ligaments.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Ah, that is exactly what we want.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>And he offers to let us have the use of his Manuscript,
if we link his name with that of his illustrious
Master in this Book. To which we cheerfully agree.
For after all, what&#8217;s in a name?</p>
<p>On the following day, lugging an enormous bundle
under each arm, the Poet came. We were stunned as
he stood in the door; we felt as if he had struck us in
the head with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the <i>Histoire Intime</i>,&#8221; said he, laying it
gently on the table.</p>
<p>And we laid our hand upon it, fetching a deep sigh.
Our misgivings, however, were lighted with a happy
idea. We will hire a few boys to read it, we thought,
and mark out the passages which please them most.
That will be just what an editor wants.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this,&#8221; continued the Poet, laying down the
other bundle, &#8220;is the original manuscript of my forthcoming
Book of Poems.&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweet of him, we thought, to present it to us.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be issued next Autumn in Cairo.&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunate City!</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you will get to work on it at once,&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercy!</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get out an English Translation in three
month, I am sure&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>We sink in our chair in breathless amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Book will then appear simultaneously both in
London and Cairo.&#8221;</p>
<p>We sit up, revived with another happy idea, and
assure the Poet that his Work will be translated into a
universal language, and that very soon. For which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
assurance he kisses us again and again, and goes away
hugging his Muse.</p>
<p>The idea! A Book of Poems to translate into
the English language! As if the English language
has not enough of its own troubles! Translate it,
O Fire, into your language! Which work the Fire
did in two minutes. And the dancing, leaping, singing
flames, the white and blue and amber flames, were
more beautiful, we thought, than anything the Ms.
might contain.</p>
<p>As for the <i>Histoire Intime</i>, we split it into three
parts and got our boys working on it. The result
was most satisfying. For now we can show, and
though he is a native of Asia, the land of the Prophets,
and though he conceals from us his origin after the
manner of the Prophets, that he was born and bred
and fed, and even thwacked, like all his fellows there,
this Khalid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE CITY OF BAAL</h3>
</div>
<p>The City of Baal, or Baalbek, is between the
desert and the deep sea. It lies at the foot of
Anti-Libanus, in the sunny plains of Coele-Syria, a
day&#8217;s march from either Damascus or Beirut. It
is a city with a past as romantic as Rome&#8217;s, as
wicked as Babel&#8217;s; its ruins testify both to its glory
and its shame. It is a city with a future as brilliant
as any New-World city; the railroad at its gate, the
modern agricultural implements in its fields, and the
porcelain bath-tubs in its hotels, can testify to this.
It is a city that enticed and still entices the mighty
of the earth; Roman Emperors in the past came to
appease the wrath of its gods, a German Emperor to-day
comes to pilfer its temples. For the Acropolis in
the poplar grove is a mine of ruins. The porphyry pillars,
the statues, the tablets, the exquisite friezes, the
palimpsests, the bas-reliefs,&ndash;&ndash;Time and the Turks
have spared a few of these. And when the German
Emperor came, Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid blinked, and the Berlin
Museum is now the richer for it.</p>
<p>Of the Temple of Jupiter, however, only six standing
columns remain; of the Temple of Bacchus only
the god and the Bacchantes are missing. And why
was the one destroyed, the other preserved, only the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
six columns, had they a tongue, could tell. Indeed,
how many blustering vandals have <i>they</i> conquered,
how many savage attacks have they resisted, what
wonders and what orgies have they beheld! These
six giants of antiquity, looking over Anti-Lebanon
in the East, and down upon the meandering Leontes
in the South, and across the Syrian steppes in the
North, still hold their own against Time and the
Elements. They are the dominating feature of the
ruins; they tower above them as the Acropolis towers
above the surrounding poplars. And around their
base, and through the fissures, flows the perennial grace
of the seasons. The sun pays tribute to them in gold;
the rain, in mosses and ferns; the Spring, in
lupine flowers. And the swallows, nesting in the
portico of the Temple of Bacchus, above the curious
frieze of egg-decoration,&ndash;&ndash;as curious, too, <i>their</i> art of
egg-making,&ndash;&ndash;pour around the colossal columns their
silvery notes. Surely, these swallows and ferns and
lupine flowers are more ancient than the Acropolis.
And the marvels of extinct nations can not hold a
candle to the marvels of Nature.</p>
<p>Here, under the decaying beauty of Roman art,
lies buried the monumental boldness of the Ph&oelig;nicians,
or of a race of giants whose extinction even Homer
deplores, and whose name even the Ph&oelig;nicians could
not decipher. For might they not, too, have stood
here wondering, guessing, even as we moderns guess
and wonder? Might not the Ph&oelig;nicians have asked
the same questions that we ask to-day: Who were the
builders? and with what tools? In one of the walls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
of the Acropolis are stones which a hundred bricklayers
can not raise an inch from the ground; and
among the ruins of the Temple of Zeus are porphyry
pillars, monoliths, which fifty horses could barely
move, and the quarry of which is beyond the Syrian
desert. There, now, solve the problem for yourself.</p>
<p>Hidden in the grove of silver-tufted poplars is the
little Temple of Venus, doomed to keep company with
a Mosque. But it is a joy to stand on the bridge
above the stream that flows between them, and listen
to the muazzen in the minaret and the bulbuls in the
Temple. Mohammad calling to Venus, Venus calling
to Mohammad&ndash;&ndash;what a romance! We leave the
subject to the poet that wants it. Another Laus
Veneris to another Swinburne might suggest itself.</p>
<p>An Arab Prophet with the goddess, this time&ndash;&ndash;but
the River flows between the Temple and the Mosque.
In the city, life is one such picturesque languid stream.
The shop-keepers sit on their rugs in their stalls, counting
their beads, smoking their narghilahs, waiting indifferently
for Allah&#8217;s bounties. And the hawkers
shuffle along crying their wares in beautiful poetic
illusions,&ndash;&ndash;the flower-seller singing, &#8220;Reconcile your
mother-in-law! Perfume your spirit! Buy a jasmine
for your soul!&#8221; the seller of loaves, his tray on his
head, his arms swinging to a measured step, intoning
in pious thankfulness, &#8220;O thou Eternal, O thou
Bountiful!&#8221; The <i>sakka</i> of licorice-juice, clicking his
brass cups calls out to the thirsty one, &#8220;Come, drink
and live! Come, drink and live!&#8221; And ere you exclaim,
How quaint! How picturesque! a train of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
laden camels drives you to the wall, rudely shaking
your illusion. And the mules and donkeys, tottering
under their heavy burdens, upsetting a tray of <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'sweet-meats' across lines">sweetmeats</ins>
here, a counter of spices there, must share the
narrow street with you and compel you to move
along slowly, languidly like themselves. They seem
to take Time by the sleeve and say to it, &#8220;What&#8217;s
your hurry?&#8221; &#8220;These donkeys,&#8221; Shakib writes, quoting
Khalid, &#8220;can teach the strenuous Europeans and
hustling Americans a lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the City Square, as we issue from the congested
windings of the Bazaar, we are greeted by one of
those scrub monuments that are found in almost every
city of the Ottoman Empire. And in most cases,
they are erected to commemorate the benevolence and
public zeal of some wali or pasha who must have made
a handsome fortune in the promotion of a public enterprise.
Be this as it may. It is not our business here to
probe the corruption of any particular Government.
But we observe that this miserable botch of a monument
is to the ruins of the Acropolis, what this modern
absolutism, this effete Turkey is to the magnificent
tyrannies of yore. Indeed, nothing is duller, more
stupid, more prosaic than a modern absolutism as
compared with an ancient one. But why concern
ourselves with like comparisons? The world is better
to-day in spite of its public monuments. These little
flights or frights in marble are as snug in their little
squares, in front of their little halls, as are the majestic
ruins in their poplar groves. In both instances,
Nature and Circumstance have harmonised between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the subject and the background. Come along. And
let the rhymsters chisel on the monument whatever
they like about sculptures and the wali. To condemn
in this case is to praise.</p>
<p>We issue from the Square into the drive leading
to the spring at the foot of the mountain. On the
meadows near the stream, is always to be found a
group of Baalbekians bibbing <i>arak</i> and swaying languidly
to the mellow strains of the lute and the monotonous
melancholy of Arabic song. Among such, one
occasionally meets with a native who, failing as <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'pedler'">peddler</ins>
or merchant in America, returns to his native town,
and, utilising the chips of English he picked up in the
streets of the New-World cities, becomes a dragoman
and guide to English and American tourists.</p>
<p>Now, under this sky, between Anti-Libanus rising
near the spring, Rasulain, and the Acropolis towering
above the poplars, around these majestic ruins, amidst
these fascinating scenes of Nature, Khalid spent the
halcyon days of his boyhood. Here he trolled his favourite
ditties beating the hoof behind his donkey. For
he preferred to be a donkey-boy than to be called a
donkey at school. The pedagogue with his drivel and
discipline, he could not learn to love. The company of
muleteers was much more to his liking. The open
air was his school; and everything that riots and rejoices
in the open air, he loved. Bulbuls and beetles
and butterflies, oxen and donkeys and mules,&ndash;&ndash;these
were his playmates and friends. And when he becomes
a muleteer, he reaches in his first venture, we are told,
the top round of the ladder. This progressive scale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
in his trading, we observe. Husbanding his resources,
he was soon after, by selling his donkey,
able to buy a sumpter-mule; a year later he sells his
mule and buys a camel; and finally he sells the camel
and buys a fine Arab mare, which he gives to a tourist
for a hundred pieces of English gold. This is what
is called success. And with the tangible symbol of it,
the price of his mare, he emigrates to America. But
that is to come.</p>
<p>Let us now turn our &#8220;stereopticon on the screen
of reminiscence,&#8221; using the pictures furnished by Shakib.
But before they can be used to advantage, they
must undergo a process of retroussage. Many of the
lines need be softened, some of the shades modified,
and not a few of the etchings, absolutely worthless, we
consign to the flames. Who of us, for instance, was
not feruled and bastinadoed by the town pedagogue?
Who did not run away from school, whimpering,
snivelling, and cursing in his heart and in his
sleep the black-board and the horn-book? Nor can
we see the significance of the fact that Khalid once
smashed the icon of the Holy Virgin for whetting not
his wits, for hearing not his prayers. It may be he
was learning then the use of the sling, and instead
of killing his neighbour&#8217;s laying-hen, he broke the sacred
effigy. No, we are not warranted to draw from these
trivialities the grand results which send Shakib in
ecstasies about his Master&#8217;s genius. Nor do we for a
moment believe that the waywardness of a genius or
a prophet in boyhood is always a significant adumbration.
Shakespeare started as a deer-poacher, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Rousseau as a thief. Yet, neither the one nor the
other, as far as we know, was a plagiarist. This,
however, does not disprove the contrary proposition,
that he who begins as a thief or an iconoclast is likely
to end as such. But the actuating motive has nothing
to do with what we, in our retrospective analysis, are
pleased to prove. Not so far forth are we willing to
piddle among the knicknacks of Shakib&#8217;s <i>Histoire Intime</i>
of his Master.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how can we interest ourselves in his
fiction of history concerning Baalbek? What have
we to do with the fact or fable that Seth the Prophet
lived in this City; that Noah is buried in its vicinity;
that Solomon built the Temple of the Sun for the
Queen of Sheba; that this Prince and Poet used to
lunch in Baalbek and dine at Istachre in Afghanistan;
that the chariot of Nimrod drawn by four ph&oelig;nixes
from the Tower of Babel, lighted on Mt. Hermon
to give said Nimrod a chance to rebuild the said Temple
of the Sun? How can we bring any of these
fascinating fables to bear upon our subject? It is
<ins class="trchange" title="Was 'neverthelesss'">nevertheless</ins> significant to remark that the City of
Baal, from the Ph&oelig;nicians and Moabites down to the
Arabs and Turks, has ever been noted for its sanctuaries
of carnal lust. The higher religion, too,
found good soil here; for Baalbek gave the world many
a saint and martyr along with its harlots and poets
and philosophers. St. Minius, St. Cyril and St. Theodosius,
are the foremost among its holy children; Ste.
Odicksyia, a Magdalene, is one of its noted daughters.
These were as famous in their days as Ashtarout or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Jupiter-Ammon. As famous too is Al-Iman ul-Ouzaai
the scholar; al-Makrizi the historian; Kallinichus
the chemist, who invented the Greek fire; Kosta ibn
Luka, a doctor and philosopher, who wrote among
much miscellaneous rubbish a treaty entitled, On the
Difference Between the Mind and the Soul; and
finally the Muazzen of Baalbek to whom &#8220;even the
beasts would stop to listen.&#8221; Ay, Shakib relates
quoting al-Makrizi, who in his turn relates, quoting
one of the octogenarian Drivellers, <i>Muhaddetheen</i>
(these men are the chief sources of Arabic History)
that he was told by an eye and ear witness that
when this celebrated Muazzen was once calling the
Faithful to prayer, the camels at the creek craned their
necks to listen to the sonorous music of his voice. And
such was their delight that they forgot they were
thirsty. This, by the way of a specimen of the
<i>Muhaddetheen</i>. Now, about these historical worthies
of Baalbek, whom we have but named, Shakib writes
whole pages, and concludes&ndash;&ndash;and here is the point&ndash;&ndash;that
Khalid might be a descendant of any or all of
them! For in him, our Scribe seriously believes, are
lusty strains of many varied and opposing humours.
And although he had not yet seen the sea, he longed
when a boy for a long sea voyage, and he would sail
little paper boats down the stream to prove the fact.
In truth, that is what Shakib would prove. The devil
and such logic had a charm for us once, but no more.</p>
<p>Here is another bubble of retrospective analysis to
which we apply the needle. It is asserted as a basis
for another astounding deduction that Khalid used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
sleep in the ruined Temple of Zeus. As if ruined
temples had anything to do with the formation or deformation
of the brain-cells or the soul-afflatus! The
devil and such logic, we repeat, had once a charm for
us. But this, in brief, is how it came about. Khalid
hated the pedagogue to whom he had to pay a visit of
courtesy every day, and loved his cousin Najma whom
he was not permitted to see. And when he runs away
from the bastinado, breaking in revenge the icon of the
Holy Virgin, his father turns him away from home.
Complaining not, whimpering not, he goes. And hearing
the bulbuls calling in the direction of Najma&#8217;s
house that evening, he repairs thither. But the crabbed,
cruel uncle turns him away also, and bolts the door.
Whereupon Khalid, who was then in the first of his
teens, takes a big scabrous rock and sends it flying
against that door. The crabbed uncle rushes out,
blustering, cursing; the nephew takes up another of
those scabrous missiles and sends it whizzing across his
shoulder. The second one brushes his ear. The third
sends the blood from his temple. And this, while
beating a retreat and cursing his father and his uncle
and their ancestors back to fifty generations. He is
now safe in the poplar grove, and his uncle gives up
the charge. With a broken noddle he returns home,
and Khalid with a broken heart wends his way to the
Acropolis, the only shelter in sight. In relating this
story, Shakib mentions &#8220;the horrible old moon, who
was wickedly smiling over the town that night.&#8221; A
broken icon, a broken door, a broken pate,&ndash;&ndash;a big
price this, the crabbed uncle and the cruel father had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
to pay for thwarting the will of little Khalid. &#8220;But
he entered the Acropolis a conqueror,&#8221; says our
Scribe; &#8220;he won the battle.&#8221; And he slept in the
temple, in the portico thereof, as sound as a muleteer.
And the swallows in the niches above heard him sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning he girds his loins with a firm resolution.
No longer will he darken his father&#8217;s door.
He becomes a muleteer and accomplishes the success of
which we have spoken. His first beau id&eacute;al was to
own the best horse in Baalbek; and to be able to ride
to the camp of the Arabs and be mistaken for one of
them, was his first great ambition. Which he realises
sooner than he thought he would. For thrift, grit
and perseverance, are a few of the rough grains in his
character. But no sooner he is possessed of his ideal
than he begins to loosen his hold upon it. He sold
his mare to the tourist, and was glad he did not attain
the same success in his first love. For he loved his
mare, and he could not have loved his cousin Najma
more. &#8220;The realisation is a terrible thing,&#8221; writes
our Scribe, quoting his Master. But when this fine
piece of wisdom was uttered, whether when he was
sailing paper boats in Baalbek, or unfurling his sails in
New York, we can not say.</p>
<p>And now, warming himself on the fire of his first
ideal, Khalid will seek the shore and launch into unknown
seas towards unknown lands. From the City
of Baal to the City of Demiurgic Dollar is not in fact
a far cry. It has been remarked that he always
dreamt of adventures, of long journeys across the
desert or across the sea. He never was satisfied with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
the seen horizon, we are told, no matter how vast and
beautiful. His soul always yearned for what was beyond,
above or below, the visible line. And had not
the European tourist alienated from him the love of
his mare and corrupted his heart with the love of gold,
we might have heard of him in Mecca, in India, or in
Dahomey. But Shakib prevails upon him to turn his
face toward the West. One day, following some
tourists to the Cedars, they behold from Dahr&#8217;ul-Qadhib
the sun setting in the Mediterranean and
make up their minds to follow it too. &#8220;For the sundown,&#8221;
writes Shakib, &#8220;was more appealing to us
than the sunrise, ay, more beautiful. The one was so
near, the other so far away. Yes, we beheld the Hesperian
light that day, and praised Allah. It was the
New World&#8217;s bonfire of hospitality: the sun called to
us, and we obeyed.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>VIA DOLOROSA</h3>
</div>
<p>In their baggy, lapping trousers and crimson caps, each
carrying a bundle and a rug under his arm, Shakib
and Khalid are smuggled through the port of Beirut
at night, and safely rowed to the steamer. Indeed,
we are in a country where one can not travel without
a passport, or a password, or a little pass-money.
And the boatmen and officials of the Ottoman Empire
can better read a gold piece than a passport. So,
Shakib and Khalid, not having the latter, slip in a few
of the former, and are smuggled through. One more
longing, lingering glance behind, and the dusky peaks
of the Lebanons, beyond which their native City of
Baal is sleeping in peace, recede from view. On the
high sea of hope and joy they sail; &#8220;under the Favonian
wind of enthusiasm, on the friendly billows of
boyish dreams,&#8221; they roll. Ay, and they sing for joy.
On and on, to the gold-swept shores of distant lands,
to the generous cities and the bounteous fields of the
West, to the Paradise of the World&ndash;&ndash;to America.</p>
<p>We need not dwell too much with our Scribe, on
the repulsive details of the story of the voyage. We
ourselves have known a little of the suffering and
misery which emigrants must undergo, before they
reach that Western Paradise of the Oriental imagination.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
How they are huddled like sheep on deck from
Beirut to Marseilles; and like cattle transported
under hatches across the Atlantic; and bullied and
browbeaten by rough disdainful stewards; and made
to pay for a leathery gobbet of beef and a slice of
black flint-like bread: all this we know. But that
New World paradise is well worth these passing privations.</p>
<p>The second day at sea, when the two Baalbekian
lads are snug on deck, their rugs spread out not far
from the stalls in which Syrian cattle are shipped to
Egypt and Arab horses to Europe or America, they
rummage in their bags&ndash;&ndash;and behold, a treat! Shakib
takes out his favourite poet Al-Mutanabbi, and Khalid,
his favourite bottle, the choicest of the Ksarah distillery
of the Jesuits. For this whilom donkey-boy will begin
by drinking the wine of these good Fathers and
then their&ndash;&ndash;blood! His lute is also with him; and
he will continue to practise the few lessons which the
bulbuls of the poplar groves have taught him. No, he
cares not for books. And so, he uncorks the bottle,
hands it to Shakib his senior, then takes a nip himself,
and, thrumming his lute strings, trolls a few
doleful pieces of Arabic song. &#8220;In these,&#8221; he would
say to Shakib, pointing to the bottle and the lute, &#8220;is
real poetry, and not in that book with which you
would kill me.&#8221; And Shakib, in stingless sarcasm,
would insist that the music in Al-Mutanabbi&#8217;s lines
is just a little more musical than Khalid&#8217;s thrumming.
They quarrel about this. And in justice to both, we
give the following from the <i>Histoire Intime</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When we left our native land,&#8221; Shakib writes,
&#8220;my literary bent was not shared in the least by
Khalid. I had gone through the higher studies which,
in our hedge-schools and clerical institutions, do not
reach a very remarkable height. Enough of French
to understand the authors tabooed by our Jesuit professors,&ndash;&ndash;the
Voltaires, the Rousseaus, the Diderots;
enough of Arabic to enable one to parse and analyse
the verse of Al-Mutanabbi; enough of Church History
to show us, not how the Church wielded the sword
of persecution, but how she was persecuted herself by
the pagans and barbarians of the earth;&ndash;&ndash;of these
and such like consists the edifying curriculum. Now,
of this high phase of education, Khalid was thoroughly
immune. But his intuitive sagacity was often remarkable,
and his humour, sweet and pathetic. Once when
I was reading aloud some of the Homeric effusions of
Al-Mutanabbi, he said to me, as he was playing his
lute, &#8216;In the heart of this,&#8217; pointing to the lute, &#8216;and
in the heart of me, there be more poetry than in that
book with which you would kill me.&#8217; And one day,
after wandering clandestinely through the steamer, he
comes to me with a gesture of surprise and this: &#8216;Do
you know, there are passengers who sleep in bunks below,
over and across each other? I saw them,
billah! And I was told they pay more than we do
for such a low passage&ndash;&ndash;the fools! Think on it. I
peeped into a little room, a dingy, smelling box, which
had in it six berths placed across and above each other
like the shelves of the reed manchons we build for our
silk-worms at home. I wouldn&#8217;t sleep in one of them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
billah! even though they bribe me. This bovine fragrance,
the sight of these fine horses, the rioting of the
wind above us, should make us forget the brutality
of the stewards. Indeed, I am as content, as
comfortable here, as are their Excellencies in what is
called the Salon. Surely, we are above them&ndash;&ndash;at
least, in the night. What matters it, then, if ours is
called the Fourth Class and theirs the Primo.
Wherever one is happy, Shakib, there is the Primo.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>But this happy humour is assailed at Marseilles. His
placidity and stolid indifference are rudely shaken by
the sharpers, who differ only from the boatmen of Beirut
in that they wear pantaloons and intersperse their
Arabic with a jargon of French. These brokers, like
rapacious bats, hover around the emigrant and before
his purse is opened for the fourth time, the trick is
done. And with what ceremony, you shall see.
From the steamer the emigrant is led to a dealer in
frippery, where he is required to doff his baggy
trousers and crimson cap, and put on a suit of linsey-woolsey
and a hat of hispid felt: end of First Act;
open the purse. From the dealer of frippery, spick
and span from top to toe, he is taken to the hostelry,
where he is detained a fortnight, sometimes a
month, on the pretext of having to wait for the best
steamer: end of Second Act; open the purse.
From the hostelry at last to the steamship agent,
where they secure for him a third-class passage on a
fourth-class ship across the Atlantic: end of Third Act;
open the purse. And now that the purse is almost
empty, the poor emigrant is permitted to leave. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
send him to New York with much gratitude in his
heart and a little trachoma in his eyes. The result being
that a month later they have to look into such eyes
again. But the purse of the distressed emigrant now
being empty,&ndash;&ndash;empty as his hopes and dreams,&ndash;&ndash;the
rapacious bats hover not around him, and the door of
the verminous hostelry is shut in his face. He is left
to starve on the western shore of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Ay, even the droll humour and stolidity of Khalid,
are shaken, aroused, by the ghoulish greed, the fell inhumanity
of these sharpers. And Shakib from his
cage of fancy lets loose upon them his hyenas of satire.
In a squib describing the bats and the voyage he says:
&#8220;The voyage to America is the Via Dolorosa of the
emigrant; and the Port of Beirut, the verminous
hostelries of Marseilles, the Island of Ellis in New
York, are the three stations thereof. And if your hopes
are not crucified at the third and last station, you pass
into the Paradise of your dreams. If they are crucified,
alas! The gates of the said Paradise will be shut
against you; the doors of the hostelries will be slammed
in your face; and with a consolation and a vengeance
you will throw yourself at the feet of the sea in whose
bosom some charitable Jonah will carry you to your
native strands.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when the emigrant has a surplus of gold, when
his capital is such as can not be dissipated on a suit of
shoddy, a fortnight&#8217;s lodging, and a passage across the
Atlantic, the ingenious ones proceed with the Fourth
Act of <i>Open Thy Purse</i>. &#8220;Instead of starting in
New York as a peddler,&#8221; they say, unfolding before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
him one of their alluring schemes, &#8220;why not do so
as a merchant?&#8221; And the emigrant opens his purse
for the fourth time in the office of some French manufacturer,
where he purchases a few boxes of trinketry,&ndash;&ndash;scapulars,
prayer-beads, crosses, jewelry, gewgaws,
and such like,&ndash;&ndash;all said to be made in the Holy
Land. These he brings over with him as his stock in
trade.</p>
<p>Now, Khalid and Shakib, after passing a fortnight
in Marseilles, and going through the Fourth Act of
the Sorry Show, find their dignity as merchants rudely
crushed beneath the hatches of the Atlantic steamer.
For here, even the pleasure of sleeping on deck is
denied them. The Atlantic Ocean would not permit
of it. Indeed, everybody has to slide into their stivy
bunks to save themselves from its rising wrath. A
fortnight of such unutterable misery is quite supportable,
however, if one continues to cherish the Paradise
already mentioned. But in this dark, dingy
smelling hole of the steerage, even the poets cease to
dream. The boatmen of Beirut and the sharpers of
Marseilles we could forget; but in this grave among
a hundred and more of its kind, set over and across
each other, neither the lute nor the little that remained
in that Ksarah bottle, could bring us any solace.</p>
<p>We are told that Khalid took up his lute but once
throughout the voyage. And this when they were
permitted one night to sleep on deck. We are also
informed that Khalid had a remarkable dream, which,
to our Scribe at least, is not meaningless. And who
of us, thou silly Scribe, did not in his boyhood tell his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
dreams to his mother, who would turn them in her
interpretation inside out? But Khalid, we are
assured, continued to cherish the belief, even in
his riper days, that when you dream you are in Jannat,
for instance, you must be prepared to go through
Juhannam the following day. A method of interpretation
as ancient as Joseph, to be sure. But we quote
the dream to show that Khalid should not have followed
the setting sun. He should have turned his
face toward the desert.</p>
<p>They slept on deck that night. They drank the
wine of the Jesuits, repeated, to the mellow strains of
the lute, the song of the bulbuls, intoned the verses of
Al-Mutanabbi, and, wrapping themselves in their
rugs, fell asleep. But in the morning they were
rudely jostled from their dreams by a spurt from the
hose of the sailors washing the deck. Complaining
not, they straggle down to their bunks to change their
clothes. And Khalid, as he is doing this, implores
Shakib not to mention to him any more that New-World
paradise. &#8220;For I have dreamt last night,&#8221;
he continues, &#8220;that, in the multicoloured robes of
an Arab amir, on a caparisoned dromedary, at the
head of an immense multitude of people, I was riding
through the desert. Whereto and wherefrom, I know
not. But those who followed me seemed to know;
for they cried, &#8216;Long have we waited for thee, now
we shall enter in peace.&#8217; And at every oasis we
passed, the people came to the gate to meet us, and,
prostrating themselves before me, kissed the fringe of
my garment. Even the women would touch my boots
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
and kiss their hands, exclaiming, &#8216;<i>Allahu akbar!</i>&#8217;
And the palm trees, billah! I could see bending
towards us that we might eat of their fruits, and the
springs seemed to flow with us into the desert that we
might never thirst. Ay, thus in triumph we marched
from one camp to another, from one oasis to the next,
until we reached the City on the Hills of the Cedar
Groves. Outside the gate, we were met by the most
beautiful of its tawny women, and four of these surrounded
my camel and took the reins from my hand.
I was then escorted through the gates, into the City,
up to the citadel, where I was awaited by their Princess.
And she, taking a necklace of cowries from a bag
that hung on her breast, placed it on my head, saying,
&#8216;I crown thee King of&ndash;&ndash;&#8217; But I could not
hear the rest, which was drowned by the cheering of
the multitudes. And the cheering, O Shakib, was
drowned by the hose of the sailors. Oh, that hose! Is
it not made in the paradise you harp upon, the paradise
we are coming to? Never, therefore, mention
it to me more.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the dream, at once simple and symbolic,
which begins to worry Khalid. &#8220;For in the evening
of the day he related it to me,&#8221; writes Shakib, &#8220;I
found him sitting on the edge of his bunk brooding
over I know not what. It was the first time he had
the blues. Nay, it was the first time he looked pensive
and profound. And upon asking him the reason
for this, he said, &#8216;I am thinking of the paper-boats
which I used to sail down the stream in Baalbek, and
that makes me <ins class="trchange" title="Added closing double-quote">sad.&#8217;&#8221;</ins>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>How strange! And yet, this first event recorded by
our Scribe, in which Khalid is seen struggling with
the mysterious and unknown, is most significant.
Another instance, showing a latent phase, hitherto dormant,
in his character, we note. Among the steerage
passengers is a Syrian girl who much resembles his
cousin Najma. She was sea-sick throughout the voyage,
and when she comes out to breathe of the fresh
air, a few hours before they enter the harbour of New
York, Khalid sees her, and Shakib swears that he saw
a tear in Khalid&#8217;s eye as he stood there gazing upon
her. Poor Khalid! For though we are approaching
the last station of the Via Dolorosa, though we are
nearing the enchanted domes of the wonder-working,
wealth-worshipping City, he is inexplicably sad.</p>
<p>And Shakib, directly after swearing that he saw a
tear in his eye, writes the following: &#8220;Up to this time
I observed in my friend only the dominating traits of
a hard-headed, hard-hearted boy, stubborn, impetuous,
intractable. But from the time he related to me his
dream, a change in his character was become manifest.
In fact a new phase was being gradually unfolded.
Three things I must emphasise in this connection:
namely, the first dream he dreamt in a foreign land, the
first time he looked pensive and profound, and the first
tear he shed before we entered New York. These are
keys to the secret chamber of one&#8217;s soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, that the doors, by virtue of our Scribe&#8217;s
open-sesames, are thrown open, we enter, <i>bismillah</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ON THE WHARF OF ENCHANTMENT</h3>
</div>
<p>Not in our make-up, to be sure,&ndash;&ndash;not in the pose
which is preceded by the tantaras of a trumpet,&ndash;&ndash;do
the essential traits in our character first reveal
themselves. But truly in the little things the real self
is exteriorised. Shakib observes closely the rapid
changes in his co-adventurer&#8217;s humour, the shadowy
traits which at that time he little understood. And
now, by applying his palm to his front, he illumines
those chambers of which he speaks, and also the niches
therein. He helps us to understand the insignificant
points which mark the rapid undercurrents of the seemingly
sluggish soul of Khalid. Not in vain, therefore,
does he crystallise for us that first tear he shed in the
harbour of Manhattan. But his gush about the recondite
beauty of this pearl of melancholy, shall not be
intended upon the gustatory nerves of the Reader.
This then we note&ndash;&ndash;his description of New York harbour.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is this the gate of Paradise,&#8221; he asks, &#8220;or
the port of some subterrestrial city guarded by the
Jinn? What a marvel of enchantment is everything
around us! What manifestations of industrial
strength, what monstrosities of wealth and power, are
here! These vessels proudly putting to sea; these tenders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
scurrying to meet the Atlantic greyhound which
is majestically moving up the bay; these barges loading
and unloading schooners from every strand, distant
and near; these huge lighters carrying even railroads
over the water; these fire-boats scudding
through the harbour shrilling their sirens; these careworn,
grim, strenuous multitudes ferried across from
one enchanted shore to another; these giant structures
tickling heaven&#8217;s sides; these cable bridges, spanning
rivers, uniting cities; and this superterrestrial goddess,
torch in hand&ndash;&ndash;wake up, Khalid, and behold these
wonders. Salaam, this enchanted City! There is the
Brooklyn Bridge, and here is the Statue of Liberty
which people speak of, and which are as famous as
the Cedars of Lebanon.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Khalid is as impassive as the bronze goddess
herself. He leans over the rail, his hand supporting
his cheek, and gazes into the ooze. The stolidity of
his expression is appalling. With his mouth open as
usual, his lips relaxed, his tongue sticking out through
the set teeth,&ndash;&ndash;he looks as if his head were in a noose.
But suddenly he braces up, runs down for his lute, and
begins to serenade&ndash;&ndash;Greater New York?</p>

<p>No; not toward this City does his heart flap its
wings of song. He is on another sea, in another harbour.
Indeed, what are these wonders as compared
with those of the City of Love? The Statue of
Eros there is more imposing than the Statue of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Liberty here. And the bridges are not of iron and
concrete, but of rainbows and&ndash;&ndash;moonshine! Indeed,
both these lads are now on the wharf of enchantment;
the one on the palpable, the sensuous, the other on the
impalpable and unseen. But both, alas, are suddenly,
but temporarily, disenchanted as they are jostled out of
the steamer into the barge which brings them to the
Juhannam of Ellis Island. Here, the unhappy children
of the steerage are dumped into the Bureau of
Emigration as&ndash;&ndash;such stuff! For even in the land of
equal rights and freedom, we have a right to expect
from others the courtesy and decency which we ourselves
do not have to show, or do not know.</p>
<p>These are sturdy and adventurous foreigners whom
the grumpy officers jostle and hustle about. For
neither poverty, nor oppression, nor both together can
drive a man out of his country, unless the soul within
him awaken. Indeed, many a misventurous cowering
peasant continues to live on bread and olives in
his little village, chained in the fear of dying of hunger
in a foreign land. Only the brave and daring
spirits hearken to the voice of discontent within them.
They give themselves up to the higher aspirations of
the soul, no matter how limited such aspirations might
be, regardless of the dangers and hardship of a long
sea voyage, and the precariousness of their plans and
hopes. There may be nothing noble in renouncing
one&#8217;s country, in abandoning one&#8217;s home, in forsaking
one&#8217;s people; but is there not something remarkable in
this great move one makes? Whether for better or
for worse, does not the emigrant place himself above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
his country, his people and his Government, when he
turns away from them, when he goes forth propelled
by that inner self which demands of him a new life?</p>
<p>And might it not be a better, a cleaner, a higher
life? What say our Masters of the Island of Ellis?
Are not these straggling, smelling, downcast emigrants
almost as clean inwardly, and as pure, as the
grumpy officers who harass and humiliate them? Is
not that spirit of discontent which they cherish, and
for which they carry the cross, so to speak, across the
sea, deserving of a little consideration, a little civility,
a little kindness?</p>
<p>Even louder than this Shakib cries out, while Khalid
open-mouthed sucks his tongue. Here at the last station,
where the odours of disinfectants are worse than
the stench of the steerage, they await behind the bars
their turn; stived with Italian and Hungarian fellow
sufferers, uttering such whimpers of expectancy, exchanging
such gestures of hope. Soon they shall be
brought forward to be examined by the doctor and the
interpreting officer; the one shall pry their purses, the
other their eyes. For in this United States of
America we want clear-sighted citizens at least. And
no cold-purses, if the matter can be helped. But
neither the eyes, alas, nor the purses of our two emigrants
are conformable to the Law; the former are
filled with granulations of trachoma, the latter have
been emptied by the sharpers of Marseilles. Which
means that they shall be detained for the present; and
if within a fortnight nothing turns up in their favour,
they shall certainly be deported.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>Trachoma! a little granulation on the inner surface
of the eyelids, what additional misery does it bring
upon the poor deported emigrant? We are asked to
shed a tear for him, to weep with him over his blasted
hopes, his strangled aspirations, his estate in the mother
country sold or mortgaged,&ndash;&ndash;in either case lost,&ndash;&ndash;and
his seed of a new life crushed in its cotyledon by
the physician who might be short-sighted himself, or
even blind. But the law must be enforced for the
sake of the clear-sighted citizens of the Republic. We
will have nothing to do with these poor blear-eyed foreigners.</p>
<p>And thus our grievous Scribe would continue, if we
did not exercise the prerogative of our Editorial Divan.
Rather let us pursue our narration. Khalid is now in
the hospital, awaiting further development in his case.
But in Shakib&#8217;s, whose eyes are far gone in trachoma,
the decision of the Board of Emigration is final, irrevokable.
And so, after being detained a week in the
Emigration pen, the unfortunate Syrian must turn
his face again toward the East. Not out into the
City, but out upon the sea, he shall be turned adrift.
The grumpy officer shall grumpishly enforce the decision
of the Board by handing our Scribe to the Captain
of the first steamer returning to Europe&ndash;&ndash;if our
Scribe can be found! For this flyaway son of a
Ph&oelig;nician did not seem to wait for the decision of the
polyglot Judges of the Emigration Board.</p>
<p>And that he did escape, we are assured. For one
morning he eludes the grumpy officer, and sidles out
among his Italian neighbours who were permitted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
land. See him genuflecting now, to kiss the <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'curb-stone' across lines">curbstone</ins>
and thank Allah that he is free. But before he
can enjoy his freedom, before he can sit down and
chuckle over the success of his escapade, he must bethink
him of Khalid. He will not leave him to the
mercy of the honourable Agents of the Law, if he can
help it. Trachoma, he knows, is a hard case to cure.
And in ten days, under the care of the doctors, it
might become worse. Straightway, therefore, he puts
himself to the dark task. A few visits to the Hospital
where Khalid is detained&ndash;&ndash;the patients in those days
were not held at Ellis Island&ndash;&ndash;and the intrigue is
afoot. On the third or fourth visit, we can not make
out which, a note in Arabic is slipt into Khalid&#8217;s
pocket, and with a significant Arabic sign, Shakib takes
himself off.</p>
<p>The evening of that very day, the trachoma-afflicted
Syrian was absent from the ward. He was
carried off by Iblis,&ndash;&ndash;the porter and a few Greenbacks
assisting. Yes, even Shakib, who knew only
a few English monosyllables, could here make himself
understood. For money is one of the two universal
languages of the world, the other being love.
Indeed, money and love are as eloquent in Turkey and
Dahomey as they are in Paris or New York.</p>
<p>And here we reach one of those hedges in the
<i>Histoire Intime</i> which we must go through in spite of
the warning-signs. Between two paragraphs, to be
plain, in the one of which we are told how the two
Syrians established themselves as merchants in New
York, in the other, how and wherefor they shouldered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the peddling-box and took to the road, there is a
crossed paragraph containing a most significant revelation.
It seems that after giving the matter some
serious thought, our Scribe came to the conclusion that
it is not proper to incriminate his illustrious Master.
But here is a confession which a hundred crosses can
not efface. And if he did not want to bring the matter
to our immediate cognisance, why, we ask, did he
not re-write the page? Why did he not cover well
that said paragraph with crosses and arabesques? We
do suspect him here of chicanery; for by this plausible
recantation he would shift the responsibility to the
shoulders of the Editor, if the secret is divulged.
Be this as it may, no red crosses can conceal from us
the astounding confession, which we now give out.
For the two young Syrians, who were smuggled out
of their country by the boatmen of Beirut, and who
smuggled themselves into the city of New York (we
beg the critic&#8217;s pardon; for, being foreigners ourselves,
we ought to be permitted to stretch this term, smuggle,
to cover an Arabic metaphor, or to smuggle into it a
foreign meaning), these two Syrians, we say, became,
in their capacity of merchants, smugglers of the most
ingenious and most evasive type.</p>
<p>We now note the following, which pertains to their
business. We learn that they settled in the Syrian
Quarter directly after clearing their merchandise.
And before they entered their cellar, we are assured,
they washed their hands of all intrigues and were
shrived of their sins by the Maronite priest of the Colony.
For they were pious in those days, and right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Catholics. &#8217;Tis further set down in the <i>Histoire Intime</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;We rented a cellar, as deep and dark and damp as
could be found. And our landlord was a Teague,
nay, a kind-hearted old Irishman, who helped us put
up the shelves, and never called for the rent in the
dawn of the first day of the month. In the front
part of this cellar we had our shop; in the rear, our
home. On the floor we laid our mattresses, on the
shelves, our goods. And never did we stop to think
who in this case was better off. The safety of our
merchandise before our own. But ten days after we
had settled down, the water issued forth from the floor
and inundated our shop and home. It rose so high
that it destroyed half of our capital stock and almost
all our furniture. And yet, we continued to live in
the cellar, because, perhaps, every one of our compatriot-merchants
did so. We were all alike subject to
these inundations in the winter season. I remember
when the water first rose in our store, Khalid was so
hard set and in such a pucker that he ran out capless
and in his shirt sleeves to discover in the next street
the source of the flood. And one day, when we were
pumping out the water he asked me if I thought
this was easier than rolling our roofs in Baalbek.
For truly, the paving-roller is child&#8217;s play to this
pump. And a leaky roof is better than an inundated
cellar.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, this is not the time for brooding. They
have to pump ahead to save what remained of their
capital stock. But Khalid, nevertheless, would brood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
and jabber. And what an inundation of ideas, and
what questions!</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you,&#8221; he asks, &#8220;that the inhabitants of this
New World are better off than those of the Old?&ndash;&ndash;Can
you imagine mankind living in a huge cellar of a
world and you and I pumping the water out of its bottom?&ndash;&ndash;I
can see the palaces on which you waste your
rhymes, but mankind live in them only in the flesh.
The soul I tell you, still occupies the basement, even
the sub-cellar. And an inundated cellar at that.
The soul, Shakib, is kept below, although the high
places are vacant.&#8221;</p>
<p>And his partner sputters out his despair; for instead
of helping to pump out the water, Khalid stands
there gazing into it, as if by some miracle he would
draw it out with his eyes or with his breath. And the
poor Poet cries out, &#8220;Pump! the water is gaining
on us, and our shop is going to ruin. Pump!&#8221;
Whereupon the lazy, absent-minded one resumes
pumping, while yearning all the while for the plashing
stone-rollers and the purling eaves of his home in
Baalbek. And once in a pinch,&ndash;&ndash;they are labouring
under a peltering rain,&ndash;&ndash;he stops as is his wont to
remind Shakib of the Arabic saying, &#8220;From the
dripping ceiling to the running gargoyle.&#8221; He is
labouring again under a hurricane of ideas. And
again he asks, &#8220;Are you sure we are better off here?&#8221;</p>
<p>And our poor Scribe, knee-deep in the water below,
blusters out curses, which Khalid heeds not. &#8220;I am
tired of this job,&#8221; he growls; &#8220;the stone-roller never
drew so much on my strength, nor did muleteering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Ah, for my dripping ceiling again, for are we not now
under the running gargoyle?&#8221; And he reverts into a
stupor, leaving the world to the poet and the pump.</p>
<p>For five years and more they lead such a life in the
cellar. And they do not move out of it, lest they excite
the envy of their compatriots. But instead of
sleeping on the floor, they stretch themselves on the
counters. The rising tide teaches them this little
wisdom, which keeps the doctor and Izr&auml;il away.
Their merchandise, however,&ndash;&ndash;their crosses, and
scapulars and prayer-beads,&ndash;&ndash;are beyond hope of recovery.
For what the rising tide spares, the rascally
flyaway peddlers carry away. That is why they
themselves shoulder the box and take to the road.
And the pious old dames of the suburbs, we are told,
receive them with such exclamations of joy and wonder,
and almost tear their coats to get from them a
sacred token. For you must remember, they are from
the Holy Land. Unlike their goods, they at least are
genuine. And every Saturday night, after beating the
hoof in the country and making such fabulous profits
on their false Holy-Land gewgaws, they return to
their cellar happy and content.</p>
<p>&#8220;In three years,&#8221; writes our Scribe, &#8220;Khalid and
I acquired what I still consider a handsome fortune.
Each of us had a bank account, and a check book
which we seldom used.... In spite of which, we
continued to shoulder the peddling box and tramp
along.... And Khalid would say to me, &#8216;A
peddler is superior to a merchant; we travel and earn
money; our compatriots the merchants rust in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
cellars and lose it.&#8217; To be sure, peddling in the
good old days was most attractive. For the exercise,
the gain, the experience&ndash;&ndash;these are rich acquirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>And both Shakib and Khalid, we apprehend, have
been hitherto most moderate in their habits. The fact
that they seldom use their check books, testifies to
this. They have now a peddleress, Im-Hanna by
name, who occupies their cellar in their absence, and
keeps what little they have in order. And when they
return every Saturday night from their peddling trip,
they find the old woman as ready to serve them as a
mother. She cooks <i>mojadderah</i> for them, and sews
the bed-linen on the quilts as is done in the mother
country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The linen,&#8221; says Shakib, &#8220;was always as white as
a dove&#8217;s wing, when Im-Hanna was with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in the Khedivial Library Manuscript we find
this curious note upon that popular Syrian dish of
lentils and olive oil.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mojadderah</i>,&#8221; writes Khalid, &#8220;has a marvellous
effect upon my humour and nerves. There are certain
dishes, I confess, which give me the blues. Of
these, fried eggplants and cabbage boiled with corn-beef
on the American system of boiling, that is to say,
cooking, I abominate the most. But <i>mojadderah</i> has
such a soothing effect on the nerves; it conduces to
cheerfulness, especially when the raw onion or the
leek is taken with it. After a good round pewter
platter of this delicious dish and a dozen leeks, I feel
as if I could do the work of all mankind. And I am
then in such a beatific state of mind that I would share
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
with all mankind my sack of lentils and my pipkin of
olive oil. I wonder not at Esau&#8217;s extravagance, when
he saw a steaming mess of it. For what is a birthright
in comparison?&#8221;</p>
<p>That Shakib also shared this beatific mood, the
following quaint picture of their Saturday nights in
the cellar, will show.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bank account,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;a good round dish
of <i>mojadderah</i>, the lute for Khalid, Al-Mutanabbi for
me,&ndash;&ndash;neither of us could forego his hobby,&ndash;&ndash;and Im-Hanna,
affectionate, devoted as our mothers,&ndash;&ndash;these
were the joys of our Saturday nights in our underground
diggings. We were absolutely happy. And
we never tried to measure our happiness in those days,
or gauge it, or flay it to see if it be dead or alive, false
or real. Ah, the blessedness of that supreme unconsciousness
which wrapped us as a mother would her
babe, warming and caressing our hearts. We did not
know then that happiness was a thing to be sought.
We only knew that peddling is a pleasure, that a bank
account is a supreme joy, that a dish of <i>mojadderah</i>
cooked by Im-Hanna is a royal delight, that our dour
dark cellar is a palace of its kind, and that happiness,
like a bride, issues from all these, and, touching the
strings of Khalid&#8217;s lute, mantles us with song.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE CELLAR OF THE SOUL</h3>
</div>
<p>Heretofore, Khalid and Shakib have been
inseparable as the Pointers. They always appeared
together, went the rounds of their peddling
orbit together, and together were subject to the same
conditions and restraints. Which restraints are a sort
of sacrifice they make on the altar of friendship. One,
for instance, would never permit himself an advantage
which the other could not enjoy, or a pleasure in
which the other could not share. They even slept
under the same blanket, we learn, ate from the same
plate, puffed at the same narghilah, which Shakib
brought with him from Baalbek, and collaborated in
writing to one lady-love! A condition of unexampled
friendship this, of complete oneness. They had both
cut themselves garments from the same cloth, as the
Arabic saying goes. And on Sunday afternoon, in
garments spick and span, they would take the air in
Battery Park, where the one would invoke the Statue
of Liberty for a thought, or the gilded domes of Broadway
for a metaphor, while the other would be scouring
the horizon for the Nothingness, which is called,
in the recondite cant of the sophisticated, a vague
something.</p>
<p>In the Khedivial Library MS. we find nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
which this Battery Park might have inspired. And
yet, we can not believe that Khalid here was only attracted
by that vague something which, in his spiritual
enceinteship, he seemed to relish. Nothing? Not
even the does and kangaroos that adorn the Park distracted
or detained him? We doubt it; and Khalid&#8217;s
lute sustains us in our doubt. Ay, and so does our
Scribe; for in his <i>Histoire Intime</i> we read the following,
which we faithfully transcribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the many attractions of Battery Park, the girls
and the sea were my favourite. For the girls in a
crowd have for me a fascination which only the girls at
the bath can surpass. I love to lose myself in a
crowd, to buffet, so to speak, its waves, to nestle under
their feathery crests. For the rolling waves of
life, the tumbling waves of the sea, and the fiery waves
of Al-Mutanabbi&#8217;s poetry have always been my delight.
In Battery Park I took especial pleasure in
reading aloud my verses to Khalid, or in fact to the
sea, for Khalid never would listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I composed a few stanzas to the Milkmaid
who stood in her wagon near the lawn, rattling out
milk-punches to the boys. A winsome lass she was,
fresh in her sororiation, with fair blue eyes, a celestial
flow of auburn hair, and cheeks that suggested the
milk and cherry in the glass she rattled out to me. I
was reading aloud the stanzas which she inspired,
when Khalid, who was not listening, pointed out to me
a woman whose figure and the curves thereof were
remarkable. &#8216;Is it not strange,&#8217; said he, &#8216;how the
women here indraw their stomachs and outdraw their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
hips? And is not this the opposite of the shape which
our women cultivate?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, with the Lebanon women, the convex curve
beneath the waist is frontward, not hindward. But
that is a matter of taste, I thought, and man is partly
responsible for either convexity. I have often wondered,
however, why the women of my country cultivate
that shape. And why do they in America cultivate
the reverse of it? Needless to say that both are
pruriently titillating,&ndash;&ndash;both distentions are damnably
suggestive, quite killing. The American woman,
from a fine sense of modesty, I am told, never or seldom
ventures abroad, when big with child. But in
the kangaroo figure, the burden is slightly shifted and
naught is amiss. Ah, such haunches as are here exhibited
suggest the <i>aliats</i> of our Asiatic sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what he says about the pruriently titillating
convexities, whether frontward or hindward, suggests
a little prudery. For in his rhymes he betrays both his
comrade and himself. Battery Park and the attractions
thereof prove fatal. Elsewhere, therefore, they
must go, and begin to draw on their bank accounts.
Which does not mean, however, that they are far
from the snare. No; for when a young man begins to
suffer from what the doctors call hebephrenia, the farther
he draws away from such snares the nearer he
gets to them. And these lusty Syrians could not repel
the magnetic attraction of the polypiosis of what Shakib
likens to the <i>aliat</i> (fattail) of our Asiatic sheep.
Surely, there be more devils under such an <i>aliat</i> than
under the hat of a Jesuit. And Khalid is the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
to discover this. Both have been ensnared, however,
and both, when in the snare, have been infernally inspired.
What Khalid wrote, when he was under the
influence of feminine curves, was preserved by Shakib,
who remarks that one evening, after returning from
the Park, Khalid said to him, &#8216;I am going to write a
poem.&#8217; A fortnight later, he hands him the following,
which he jealously kept among his papers.</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'>
<span class="hang">I dreamt I was a donkey-boy again.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Out on the sun-swept roads of Baalbek, I tramp behind my burro, trolling my <i>mulayiah</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">At noon, I pass by a garden redolent of mystic scents and tarry awhile.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Under an orange tree, on the soft green grass, I stretch my limbs.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">The daisies, the anemones, and the cyclamens are round me pressing:<br /></span>
<span class="hang">The anemone buds hold out to me their precious rubies; the daisies kiss me in the eyes and lips; and the cyclamens shake their powder in my hair.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">On the wall, the roses are nodding, smiling; above me the orange blossoms surrender themselves to the wooing breeze; and on yonder rock the salamander sits, complacent and serene.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">I take a daisy, and, boy as boys go, question its petals:<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Married man or monk, I ask, plucking them off one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="hang">And the last petal says, Monk.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">I perfume my fingers with crumpled cyclamens, cover my face with the dark-eyed anemones, and fall asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">And my burro sleeps beneath the wall, in the shadow of nodding roses.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">And the black-birds too are dozing, and the bulbuls flitting by whisper with their wings, &#8216;salaam.&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Peace and salaam!<br /></span>
<span class="hang">The bulbul, the black-bird, the salamander, the burro, and the burro-boy, are to each other shades of noon-day sun:<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Happy, loving, generous, and free;&ndash;&ndash;<br /></span>
<span class="hang">As happy as each other, and as free.<br /></span>

<span class="hang">A goblin taller than the tallest poplar, who carries me upon his neck to the Park in far New York.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Here women, light-heeled, heavy-haunched, pace up and down the flags in graceful gait.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">My roses these, I cry, and my orange blossoms.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">But the goblin placed his hand upon my mouth, and I was dumb.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">The cyclamens, the anemones, the daisies, I saw them, but I could not speak to them.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">The goblin placed his hand upon my mouth, and I was dumb.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">O take me back to my own groves, I cried, or let me speak.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">But he threw me off his shoulders in a huff, among the daisies and the cyclamens.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Alone among them, but I could not speak.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">He had tied my tongue, the goblin, and left me there alone.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">And in front of me, and towards me, and beside me,<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Walked Allah&#8217;s fairest cyclamens and anemones.<br /></span>
<span class="hang">I smell them, and the tears flow down my cheeks;<br /></span>
<span class="hang">I can not even like the noon-day bulbul<br /></span>
<span class="hang">Whisper with my wings, salaam!<br /></span>
<span class="hang">I sit me on a bench and weep.<br /></span>

<p>Shades of Whitman! But Whitman, thou Donkey,
never weeps. Whitman, if that goblin tried to silence
him, would have wrung his neck, after he had ridden
upon it. The above, nevertheless, deserves the space
we give it here, as it shadows forth one of the essential
elements of Khalid&#8217;s spiritual make-up. But this
slight symptom of that disease we named, this morbidness
incident to adolescence, is eventually overcome by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
a dictionary and a grammar. Ay, Khalid henceforth
shall cease to scour the horizon for that vague something
of his dreams; he has become far-sighted enough
by the process to see the necessity of pursuing in
America something more spiritual than peddling
crosses and scapulars. Especially in this America,
where the alphabet is spread broadcast, and free of
charge. And so, he sets himself to the task of self-education.
He feels the embryo stir within him, and
in the squeamishness of enceinteship, he asks but for a
few of the fruits of knowledge. Ah, but he becomes
voracious of a sudden, and the little pocket dictionary
is devoured entirely in three sittings. Hence his folly
of treating his thoughts and fancies, as he was treated
by the goblin. For do not words often rob a fancy of
its tongue, or a thought of its soul? Many of the
pieces Khalid wrote when he was devouring dictionaries
were finally disposed of in a most picturesque
manner, as we shall relate. And a few were given to
Shakib, of which that Dream of Cyclamens was preserved.</p>
<p>And Khalid&#8217;s motto was, &#8220;One book at a time.&#8221;
He would not encumber himself with books any more
than he would with shoes. But that the mind might
not go barefoot, he always bought a new book before
destroying the one in hand. Destroying? Yes; for
after reading or studying a book, he warms his hands
upon its flames, this Khalid, or makes it serve to cook
a pot of <i>mojadderah</i>. In this extraordinary and outrageous
manner, barbarously capricious, he would baptise
the ideal in the fire of the real. And thus, glowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
with health and confidence and conceit, he enters
another Park from which he escapes in the end, sad
and wan and bankrupt. Of a truth, many attractions
and distractions are here; else he could not forget the
peddling-box and the light-heeled, heavy-haunched
women of Battery Park. Here are swings for the
mind; toboggan-chutes for the soul; merry-go-rounds
for the fancy; and many devious and alluring paths
where one can lose himself for years. A sanitarium
this for the hebephreniac. And like all sanitariums,
you go into it with one disease and come out of it with
ten. Had Shakib been forewarned of Khalid&#8217;s mind,
had he even seen him at the gate before he entered, he
would have given him a few hints about the cross-signs
and barbed-cordons therein. But should he not
have divined that Khalid soon or late was coming?
Did <i>he</i> not call enough to him, and aloud? &#8220;Get
thee behind me on this dromedary,&#8221; our Scribe, reading
his Al-Mutanabbi, would often say to his comrade,
&#8220;and come from this desert of barren gold, if but
for a day,&ndash;&ndash;come out with me to the oasis of poesy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Khalid would only ride alone. And so,
he begins his course of self-education. But how
he shall manage it, in this cart-before-the-horse
fashion, the reader shall know. Words before rules,
ideas before systems, epigrams before texts,&ndash;&ndash;that is
Khalid&#8217;s fancy. And that seems feasible, though not
logical; it will prove effectual, too, if one finally
brushed the text and glanced at the rules. For an
epigram, when it takes possession of one, goes farther
in influencing his thoughts and actions than whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
tomes of ethical culture science. You know perhaps
how the Arabs conquered the best half of the world
with an epigram, a word. And Khalid loves a fine-sounding,
easy-flowing word; a word of supple joints,
so to speak; a word that you can twist and roll out,
flexible as a bamboo switch, resilient as a fine steel
rapier. But once Shakib, after reading one of Khalid&#8217;s
first attempts, gets up in the night when his
friend is asleep, takes from the bottom drawer of the
peddling-box the evil-working dictionary, and places
therein a grammar. This touch of delicacy, this fine
piece of criticism, brief and neat, without words
withal, Khalid this time is not slow to grasp and
appreciate. He plunges, therefore, headlong into the
grammar, turns a few somersaults in the mazes of
Sibawai and Naftawai, and coming out with a broken
noddle, writes on the door the following: &#8220;What do
I care about your theories of nouns and verbs?
Whether the one be derived from the other, concerns
not me. But this I know, after stumbling once or
twice in your labyrinths, one comes out parsing the
verb, to run. Indeed, verbs are more essential than
nouns and adjectives. A noun can be represented pictorially;
but how, pictorially, can you represent a
noun in motion,&ndash;&ndash;Khalid, for instance, running out of
your labyrinths? Even an abstract state can be represented
in a picture, but a transitive state never. The
richest language, therefore, is not the one which can
boast of a thousand names for the lion or two thousand
for the camel, but the one whose verbs have a
complete and perfect gamut of moods and tenses.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>That is why, although writing in Arabic, Khalid
prefers English. For the Arabic verb is confined to
three tenses, the primary ones only; and to break
through any of these in any degree, requires such
crowbars as only auxiliaries and other verbs can
furnish. For this and many other reasons Khalid
stops short in the mazes of Sibawai, runs out of them
exasperated, depressed, and never for a long time after
looks in that direction. He is now curious to know if
the English language have its Sibawais and Naftawais.
And so, he buys him a grammar, and there
finds the way somewhat devious, too, but not enough
to constitute a maze. The men who wrote these
grammars must have had plenty of time to do a little
useful work. They do not seem to have walked leisurely
in flowing robes disserting a life-long dissertation
on the origin and descent of a preposition. One
day Shakib is amazed by finding the grammars page
by page tacked on the walls of the cellar and Khalid
pacing around leisurely lingering a moment before
each page, as if he were in an art gallery. That is
how he tackled his subject. And that is why he and
Shakib begin to quarrel. The idea! That a fledgling
should presume to pick flaws. To Shakib, who
is textual to a hair, this is intolerable. And that state
of oneness between them shall be subject hereafter to
&#8220;the corrosive action of various unfriendly agents.&#8221;
For Khalid, who has never yet been snaffled, turns
restively from the bit which his friend, for his own
sake, would put in his mouth. The rupture follows.
The two for a while wend their way in opposite directions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
Shakib still cherishing and cultivating his bank
account, shoulders his peddling-box and jogs along with
his inspiring demon, under whose auspices, he tells us,
he continues to write verse and gull with his brummagems
the pious dames of the suburbs. And Khalid
sits on his peddling-box for hours pondering on the
necessity of disposing of it somehow. For now he
scarcely makes more than a few peddling-trips each
month, and when he returns, he does not go to the
bank to add to his balance, but to draw from it. That
is why the accounts of the two Syrians do not fare
alike; Shakib&#8217;s is gaining in weight, Khalid&#8217;s is wasting
away.</p>
<p>Yes, the strenuous spirit is a long time dead in
Khalid. He is gradually reverting to the Oriental
instinct. And when he is not loafing in Battery
Park, carving his name on the bench, he is burrowing
in the shelves of some second-hand book-shop
or dreaming in the dome of some Broadway skyscraper.
Does not this seem inevitable, however, considering
the palingenetic burden within him? And is
not loafing a necessary prelude to the travail?
Khalid, of course, felt the necessity of this, not knowing
the why and wherefor. And from the vast world
of paper-bound souls, for he relished but pamphlets at
the start&ndash;&ndash;they do not make much smoke in the fire,
he would say&ndash;&ndash;from that vast world he could command
the greatest of the great to help him support the
loafing while. And as by a miracle, he came out of
that chaos of contending spirits without a scratch.
He enjoyed the belligerency of pamphleteers as an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
American would enjoy a prize fight. But he sided
with no one; he took from every one his best and consigned
him to Im-Hanna&#8217;s kitchen. Torquemada
could not have done better; but Khalid, it is hoped,
will yet atone for his crimes.</p>
<p>Monsieur Pascal, with whom he quarrels before he
burns, had a particular influence upon him. He could
not rest after reading his &#8220;Thoughts&#8221; until he read
the Bible. And of the Prophets of the Old Testament
he had an especial liking for Jeremiah and Isaiah.
And once he bought a cheap print of Jeremiah which
he tacked on the wall of his cellar. From the Khedivial
Library MS. we give two excerpts relating to
Pascal and this Prophet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;O Monsieur Pascal,</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried hard to hate and detest myself, as you advise, and
I found that I could not by so doing love God. &#8217;Tis in
loving the divine in Man, in me, in you, that we rise to
the love of our Maker. And in giving your proofs of the
true religion, you speak of the surprising measures of the
Christian Faith, enjoining man to acknowledge himself vile,
base, abominable, and obliging him at the same time to aspire
towards a resemblance of his Maker. Now, I see in
this a foreshadowing of the theory of evolution, nay a divine
warrant for it. Nor is it the Christian religion alone which
unfolds to man the twofold mystery of his nature; others
are as dark and as bright on either side of the pole. And
Philosophy conspiring with Biology will not consent to the
apotheosis of Man, unless he wear on his breast a symbol of
his tail.... <i>Au-revoir</i>, Monsieur Pascal, Remember
me to St. Augustine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Jeremiah,</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy picture, sitting among the ruins of the City of Zion,
appeals to my soul. Why, I know not. It may be because
I myself once sat in that posture among the ruins of my native
City of Baal. But the ruins did not grieve me as did
the uncle who slammed the door in my face that night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
True, I wept in the ruins, but not over them. Something
else had punctured the bladderets of my tears. And who
knows who punctured thine, O Jeremiah? Perhaps a daughter
of Tamar had stuck a bodkin in thine eye, and in lamenting
thine own fate&ndash;&ndash;Pardon me, O Jeremiah. Melikes not
all these tears of thine. Nor did Zion and her children in
Juhannam, I am sure.... Instead of a scroll in thy
hand, I would have thee hold a harp. Since King David,
Allah has not thought of endowing his prophets with musical
talent. Why, think what an honest prophet could accomplish
if his message were put into music. And withal,
if he himself could sing it. Yes, our modern Jeremiahs
should all take music lessons; for no matter how deep and
poignant our sorrows, we can always rise from them, harp
in hand, to an ecstasy, joyous and divine.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, connect with this the following from the
<i>Histoire Intime</i>, and you have the complete history of
this Prophet in Khalid&#8217;s cellar. For Khalid himself
never gives us the facts in the case. Our Scribe, however,
comes not short in this.</p>
<p>&#8220;The picture of the Prophet Jeremiah,&#8221; writes he,
&#8220;Khalid hung on the wall, above his bed. And
every night he would look up to it invokingly, muttering
I know not what. One evening, while in this
posture, he took up his lute and trolled a favourite
ditty. For three days and three nights that picture
hung on the wall. And on the morning of the fourth
day&ndash;&ndash;it was a cold December morning, I remember&ndash;&ndash;he
took it down and lighted the fire with it. The
Pamphlet he had read a few days since, he also threw
into the fire, and thereupon called to me saying, &#8216;Come,
Shakib, and warm yourself.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Pamphlet, we learn, which was thus baptised
in the same fire with the Prophet&#8217;s picture, was
Tom Paine&#8217;s <i>Age of Reason</i>.</p>
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE SUMMER AFTERNOON OF A SHAM</h3>
</div>
<p>For two years and more Khalid&#8217;s young mind
went leaping from one swing to another, from
one carousel or toboggan-chute to the next, without
having any special object in view, without knowing
why and wherefor. He even entered such mazes of
philosophy, such labyrinths of mysticism as put those
of the Arabian grammaticasters in the shade. To
him, education was a sport, pursued in a free spirit
after his own fancy, without method or discipline.
For two years and more he did little but ramble thus,
drawing meanwhile on his account in the bank, and
burning pamphlets.</p>
<p>One day he passes by a second-hand book-shop,
which is in the financial hive of the city, hard by a
church and within a stone&#8217;s throw from the Stock
Exchange. The owner, a shabby venerable, standing
there, pipe in mouth, between piles of pamphlets and
little pyramids of books, attracts Khalid. He too
occupies a cellar. And withal he resembles the
Prophet in the picture which was burned with Tom
Paine&#8217;s <i>Age of Reason</i>. Nothing in the face at least
is amiss. A flowing, serrated, milky beard, with a
touch of gold around the mouth; an aquiline nose;
deep set blue eyes canopied with shaggy brows; a forehead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
broad and high; a dome a little frowsy but not
guilty of a hair&ndash;&ndash;the Prophet Jeremiah! Only one
thing, a clay pipe which he seldom took out of his
mouth except to empty and refill, seemed to take from
the prophetic solemnity of the face. Otherwise, he is
as grim and sullen as the Prophet. In his voice,
however, there is a supple sweetness which the hard
lines in his face do not express. Khalid nicknames
him second-hand Jerry, makes to him professions of
friendship, and for many months comes every day to
see him. He comes with his bucket, as he would say,
to Jerry&#8217;s well. For the two, the young man and the
old man of the cellar, the neophite and the master,
would chat about literature and the makers of it for
hours. And what a sea of information is therein under
that frowsy dome. Withal, second-hand Jerry is
a man of ideals and abstractions, exhibiting now and
then an heretical twist which is as agreeable as the
vermiculations in a mahogany. &#8220;We moderns,&#8221;
said he once to Khalid, &#8220;are absolutely one-sided.
Here, for instance, is my book-shop, there
is the Church, and yonder is the Stock Exchange.
Now, the men who frequent them, and though their
elbows touch, are as foreign to each other as is a jerboa
to a polar bear. Those who go to Church do not go
to the Stock Exchange; those who spend their days on
the Stock Exchange seldom go to Church; and those
who frequent my cellar go neither to the one nor the
other. That is why our civilisation produces so many
bigots, so many philistines, so many pedants and prigs.
The Stock Exchange is as necessary to Society as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
Church, and the Church is as vital, as essential to its
spiritual well-being as my book-shop. And not until
man develops his mental, spiritual and physical faculties
to what Matthew Arnold calls &#8216;a harmonious perfection,&#8217;
will he be able to reach the heights from which
Idealism is waving to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus would the master discourse, and the neophite,
sitting on the steps of the cellar, smoking his cigarette,
listens, admiring, pondering. And every time
he comes with his bucket, Jerry would be standing
there, between his little pyramids of books, pipe in
mouth, hands in pockets, ready for the discourse. He
would also conduct through his underworld any one
who had the leisure and inclination. But fortunately
for Khalid, the people of this district are either too
rich to buy second-hand books, or too snobbish to
stop before this curiosity shop of literature. Hence
the master is never too busy; he is always ready to
deliver the discourse.</p>
<p>One day Khalid is conducted into the labyrinthine
gloom and mould of the cellar. Through the narrow
isles, under a low ceiling, papered, as it were, with
pamphlets, between ramparts and mounds of books,
old Jerry, his head bowed, his lighted taper in hand,
proceeds. And Khalid follows directly behind, listening
to his guide who points out the objects and places
of interest. And thus, through the alleys and by-ways,
through the nooks and labyrinths of these underground
temple-ruins, we get to the rear, where the
ramparts and mounds crumble to a mighty heap, rising
pell-mell to the ceiling. Here, one is likely to get a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
glimpse into such enchanted worlds as the name of a
Dickens or a Balzac might suggest. Here, too, is
Shakespeare in lamentable state; there is Carlyle in
rags, still crying, as it were, against the filth and beastliness
of this underworld. And look at my lord Tennyson
shivering in his nakedness and doomed to keep
company with the meanest of poetasters. Observe
how Emerson is wriggled and ruffled in this crushing
crowd. Does he not seem to be still sighing for a
little solitude? But here, too, are spots of the rarest
literary interest. Close to the vilest of dime novels is
an autograph copy of a book which you might not find
at Brentano&#8217;s. Indeed, the rarities here stand side by
side with the superfluities&ndash;&ndash;the abominations with the
blessings of literature&ndash;&ndash;cluttered together, reduced to
a common level. And all in a condition which bespeaks
the time when they were held in the affection
of some one. Now, they lie a-mouldering in these
mounds, and on these shelves, awaiting a curious eye,
a kindly hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;To me,&#8221; writes Khalid in the K. L. MS., &#8220;there is always
something pathetic in a second-hand book offered again
for sale. Why did its first owner part with it? Was it out
of disgust or surfeit or penury? Did he throw it away, or
give it away, or sell it? Alas, and is this how to treat a
friend? Were it not better burned, than sold or thrown
away? After coming out of the press, how many have
handled this tattered volume? How many has it entertained,
enlightened, or perverted? Look at its pages, which evidence
the hardship of the journey it has made. Here still is
a pressed flower, more convincing in its shrouded eloquence
than the philosophy of the pages in which it lies buried. On
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
the fly-leaf are the names of three successive owners, and on
the margin are lead pencil notes in which the reader criticises
the author. Their spirits are now shrouded together
and entombed in this pile, where the mould never fails and
the moths never die. They too are fallen a prey to the
worms of the earth. A second-hand book-shop always reminds
me of a Necropolis. It is a kind of Serapeum where
lies buried the kings and princes with the helots and underlings
of literature. Ay, every book is a mortuary chamber
containing the remains of some poor literary wretch, or some
mighty genius.... A book is a friend, my brothers,
and when it ceases to entertain or instruct or inspire, it is
dead. And would you sell a dead friend, would you throw
him away? If you can not keep him embalmed on your
shelf, is it not the wiser part, and the kinder, to cremate
him?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Khalid tells old Jerry, that if every one buying
and reading books, disposed of them in the end as
he himself does, second-hand book-shops would no
longer exist. But old Jerry never despairs of business.
And the idea of turning his Serapeum into a kiln does
not appeal to him. Howbeit, Khalid has other ideas
which the old man admires, and which he would carry
out if the police would not interfere. &#8220;If I were the
owner of this shop,&#8221; thus the neophite to the master,
&#8220;I would advertise it with a bonfire of pamphlets. I
would take a few hundreds from that mound there
and give them the match right in front of that
Church, or better still before the Stock Exchange.
And I would have two sandwich-men stand about the
bonfire, as high priests of the Temple, and chant the
praises of second-hand Jerry and his second-hand book-shop.
This will be the sacrifice which you will have
offered to the god of Trade right in front of his sanctuary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
that he might soften the induration in the
breasts of these worthy citizens, your rich neighbours.
And if he does not, why, shut up shop or burn it up,
and let us go out peddling together.&#8221;</p>
<p>We do not know, however, whether old Jerry ever
adopted Khalid&#8217;s idea. He himself is an Oriental in
this sense; and the business is good enough to keep up,
so long as Khalid comes. He is supremely content.
Indeed, Shakib asseverates in round Arabic, that the
old man of the cellar got a good portion of Khalid&#8217;s
balance, while balancing Khalid&#8217;s mind. Nay, firing
it with free-thought literature. Are we then to consider
this cellar as Khalid&#8217;s source of spiritual illumination?
And is this genial old heretic an American
avatar of the monk Bohaira? For Khalid is gradually
becoming a man of ideas and crotchets. He is beginning
to see a purpose in all his literary and spiritual
rambles. His mental nebulosity is resolving itself into
something concrete, which shall weigh upon him for
a while and propel him in the direction of Atheism
and Demagogy. For old Jerry once visits Khalid in
his cellar, and after partaking of a dish of <i>mojadderah</i>,
takes him to a political meeting to hear the popular
orators of the day.</p>
<p>And in this is ineffable joy for Khalid. Like every
young mind he is spellbound by one of those masters
of spread-eagle oratory, and for some time he does not
miss a single political meeting in his district. We
even see him among the crowd before the corner groggery,
cheering one of the political spouters of the day.</p>
<p>And once he accompanies Jerry to the Temple of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Atheism to behold its high Priest and hear him chant
halleluiah to the Nebular Hypothesis. This is wonderful.
How easy it is to dereligionise the human
race and banish God from the Universe! But after
the High Priest had done this, after he had proven to
the satisfaction of every atheist that God is a myth,
old Jerry turns around and gives Khalid this warning:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe all he says, for I know that atheist
well. He is as eloquent as he is insincere.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so are all atheists. For at bottom, atheism
is either a fad or a trade or a fatuity. And whether
the one or the other, it is a sham more pernicious than
the worst. To the young mind, it is a shibboleth of
cheap culture; to the shrewd and calculating mind, to
such orators as Khalid heard, it is a trade most remunerative;
and to the scientists, or rather monists,
it is the aliment with which they nourish the perversity
of their preconceptions. Second-hand Jerry did
not say these things to our young philosopher; for had
he done so, Khalid, now become edacious, would not
have experienced those dyspeptic pangs which almost
crushed the soul-fetus in him. For we are told that
he is as sedulous in attending these atheistic lectures
as he is in flocking with his fellow citizens to hear and
cheer the idols of the stump. Once he took Shakib to
the Temple of Atheism, but the Poet seems to prefer
his <ins class="trchange" title="As originally printed"><i>Al-Mutanabby</i></ins>. In relating of Khalid&#8217;s waywardness
he says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since we quarrelled about Sibawai, Khalid and
I have seldom been together. And he had become so
opinionated that I was glad it was so. Even on Sunday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
I would leave him alone with Im-Hanna, and returning
in the evening, I would find him either reading
or burning a pamphlet. Once I consented to accompany
him to one of the lectures he was so fond of attending.
And I was really surprised that one had to
pay money for such masquerades of eloquence as were
exhibited that night on the platform. Yes, it occurred
to me that if one had not a dollar one could not become
an atheist. Billah! I was scandalized. For
no matter how irreverent one likes to pose, one ought
to reverence at least his Maker. I am a Christian by
the grace of Allah, and my ancestors are counted among
the martyrs of the Church. And thanks to my parents,
I have been duly baptized and confirmed. For
which I respect them the more, and love them. Now,
is it not absurd that I should come here and pay a
hard dollar to hear this heretical speechifier insult my
parents and my God? Better the ring of Al-Mutanabbi&#8217;s
scimitars and spears than the clatter of these
atheistical bones!&#8221;</p>
<p>From which we infer that Shakib was not open to
reason on the subject. He would draw his friend
away from the verge of the abyss at any cost. &#8220;And
this,&#8221; continues he, &#8220;did not require much effort.
For Khalid like myself is constitutionally incapable of
denying God. We are from the land in which God
has always spoken to our ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the argument between the shrewd verse-maker
and the foolish philosopher finally hinges on this:
namely, that these atheists are not honest investigators,
that in their sweeping generalisations, as in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
speciosity and hypocrisy, they are commercially perverse.
And Khalid is not long in deciding about the
matter. He meets with an accident&ndash;&ndash;and accidents
have always been his touchstones of success&ndash;&ndash;which
saves his soul and seals the fate of atheism.</p>
<p>One evening, returning from a ramble in the Park,
he passes by the Hall where his favourite Mountebank
was to lecture on the Gospel of Soap. But not having
the price of admittance that evening, and being anxious
to hear the orator whom he had idolised, Khalid
bravely appeals to his generosity in this quaint and
touching note: &#8220;My pocket,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;is empty
and my mind is hungry. Might I come to your
Table to-night as a beggar?&#8221; And the man at the
stage door, who carries the note to the orator, returns
in a trice, and tells Khalid to lift himself off.
Khalid hesitates, misunderstands; and a heavy hand is
of a sudden upon him, to say nothing of the heavy
boot.</p>
<p>Ay, and that boot decided him. Atheism, bald,
bold, niggardly, brutal, pretending withal, Khalid
turns from its door never to look again in that direction,
Shakib is right. &#8220;These people,&#8221; he growled,
&#8220;are not free thinkers, but free stinkards. They do
need soap to wash their hearts and souls.&#8221;</p>
<p>An idea did not come to Khalid, as it were, by instalments.
In his puerperal pains of mind he was
subject to such crises, shaken by such downrushes of
light, as only the few among mortals experience.
(We are quoting our Scribe, remember.) And in certain
moments he had more faith in his instincts than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
in his reason. &#8220;Our instincts,&#8221; says he, &#8220;never lie.
They are honest, and though they be sometimes
blind.&#8221; And here, he seems to have struck the truth.
He can be practical too. Honesty in thought, in
word, in deed&ndash;&ndash;this he would have as the cornerstone
of his truth. Moral rectitude he places above
all the cardinal virtues, natural and theological.
&#8220;Better keep away from the truth, O Khalid,&#8221; he
writes, &#8220;better remain a stranger to it all thy life, if
thou must sully it with the slimy fingers of a mercenary
juggler.&#8221; Now, these brave words, we can not
in conscience criticise. But we venture to observe that
Khalid must have had in mind that Gospel of Soap
and the incident at the stage door.</p>
<p>And in this, we, too, rejoice. We, too, forgetting
the dignity of our position, participate of the revelry
in the cellar on this occasion. For our editorialship,
dear Reader, is neither American nor English. We
are not bound, therefore, to maintain in any degree the
algidity and indifference of our confr&egrave;res&#8217; sublime
attitude. We rejoice in the spiritual safety of
Khalid. We rejoice that he and Shakib are now
reconciled. For the reclaimed runagate is now even
permitted to draw on the poet&#8217;s balance at the banker.
Ay, even Khalid can dissimulate when he needs the
cash. For with the assistance of second-hand Jerry
and the box-office of the atheistical jugglers, he had
exhausted his little saving. He would not even go
out peddling any more. And when Shakib asks him
one morning to shoulder the box and come out, he replies:
&#8220;I have a little business with it here.&#8221; For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
after having impeached the High Priests of Atheism he
seems to have turned upon himself. We translate
from the K. L. MS.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was disenchanted with atheism, when I
saw somewhat of the meanness and selfishness of its
protagonists, I began to doubt in the honesty of men.
If these, our supposed teachers, are so vile, so mercenary,
so false,&ndash;&ndash;why, welcome Juhannam! But the
more I doubted in the honesty of men, the more did I
believe that honesty should be the cardinal virtue of
the soul. I go so far in this, that an honest thief in
my eyes is more worthy of esteem than a canting materialist
or a hypocritical free thinker. Still, the voice
within me asked if Shakib were honest in his dealings,
if I were honest in my peddling? Have I not misrepresented
my gewgaws as the atheist misrepresents
the truth? &#8216;This is made in the Holy Land,&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;This
is from the Holy Sepulchre&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;these lies, O Khalid,
are upon you. And what is the difference between the
jewellery you passed off for gold and the arguments of
the atheist-preacher? Are they not both instruments
of deception, both designed to catch the dollar? Yes,
you have been, O Khalid, as mean, as mercenary, as
dishonest as those canting infidels.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are you going to do about it? Will
you continue, while in the quagmires yourself, to
point contemptuously at those standing in the gutter?
Will you, in your dishonesty, dare impeach the honesty
of men? Are you not going to make a resolution
now, either to keep silent or to go out of the
quagmires and rise to the mountain-heights? Be pure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
yourself first, O Khalid; then try to spread this purity
around you at any cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that is why, when Shakib asked me to go out
peddling one day, I hesitated and finally refused. For
atheism, in whose false dry light I walked a parasang
or two, did not only betray itself to me as a sham, but
also turned my mind and soul to the sham I had
shouldered for years. From the peddling-box, therefore,
I turned even as I did from atheism. Praised be
Allah, who, in his providential care, seemed to kick me
away from the door of its temple. The sham,
although effulgent and alluring, was as brief as a summer
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the peddling-box, our Scribe will tell of its
fate in the following Chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>IN THE TWILIGHT OF AN IDEA</h3>
</div>
<p>It is Voltaire, we believe, who says something to
the effect that one&#8217;s mind should be in accordance
with one&#8217;s years. That is why an academic education
nowadays often fails of its purpose. For whether
one&#8217;s mind runs ahead of one&#8217;s years, or one&#8217;s years
ahead of one&#8217;s mind, the result is much the same; it
always goes ill with the mind. True, knowledge is
power; but in order to feel at home with it, we must
be constitutionally qualified. And if we are not, it is
likely to give the soul such a wrenching as to deform
it forever. Indeed, how many of us go through life
with a fatal spiritual or intellectual twist which could
have been avoided in our youth, were we a little less
wise. The young <i>philosophes</i>, the products of the
University Machine of to-day, who go about with a
nosegay of -isms, as it were, in their lapels, and perfume
their speech with the bottled logic of the College
Professor,&ndash;&ndash;are not most of them incapable of honestly
and bravely grappling with the real problems of
life? And does not a systematic education mean this,
that a young man must go through life dragging behind
him his heavy chains of set ideas and stock systems,
political, social, or religious? (Remember, we
are translating from the Khedivial Library MS.)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
The author continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Whether one devour the knowledge of the world in four
years or four nights, the process of assimilation is equally
hindered, if the mind is sealed at the start with the seal of
authority. Ay, we can not be too careful of dogmatic science
in our youth; for dogmas often dam certain channels of the
soul through which we might have reached greater treasures
and ascended to purer heights. A young man, therefore,
ought to be let alone. There is an infinite possibility of
soul-power in every one of us, if it can be developed freely,
spontaneously, without discipline or restraint. There is, too,
an infinite possibility of beauty in every soul, if it can be
evoked at an auspicious moment by the proper word, the
proper voice, the proper touch. That is why I say, Go thy
way, O my Brother. Be simple, natural, spontaneous, courageous,
free. Neither anticipate your years, nor lag child-like
behind them. For verily, it is as ridiculous to dye the
hair white as to dye it black. Ah, be foolish while thou art
young; it is never too late to be wise. Indulge thy fancy,
follow the bent of thy mind; for in so doing thou canst not
possibly do thyself more harm than the disciplinarians can
do thee. Live thine own life; think thine own thoughts;
keep developing and changing until thou arrive at the truth
thyself. An ounce of it found by thee were better than a
ton given to thee <i>gratis</i> by one who would enslave thee. Go
thy way, O my Brother. And if my words lead thee to
Juhannam, why, there will be a great surprise for thee.
There thou wilt behold our Maker sitting on a flaming glacier
waiting for the like of thee. And he will take thee into
his arms and poke thee in the ribs, and together you will
laugh and laugh, until that glacier become a garden and
thou a flower therein. Go thy way, therefore; be not afraid.
And no matter how many tears thou sheddest on this side,
thou wilt surely be poked in the ribs on the other. Go&ndash;&ndash;thy&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;let
Nature be thy guide; acquaint thyself with one
or two of her laws ere thou runnest wild.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to what extent did this fantastic mystic son of
a Ph&oelig;nician acquaint himself with Nature&#8217;s laws, we
do not know. But truly, he was already running wild
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
in the great cosmopolis of New York. From his stivy
cellar he issues forth into the plashing, plangent currents
of city life. Before he does this, however, he
rids himself of all the encumbrances of peddlery which
hitherto have been his sole means of support. His
little stock of crosses, rosaries, scapulars, false jewellery,
mother-of-pearl gewgaws, and such like, which he has
on the little shelf in the cellar, he takes down one
morning&ndash;&ndash;but we will let our Scribe tell the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;My love for Khalid,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;has been
severely tried. We could no longer agree about anything.
He had become such a dissenter that often
would he take the wrong side of a question if only
for the sake of bucking. True, he ceased to frequent
the cellar of second-hand Jerry, and the lectures of the
infidels he no longer attended. We were in accord
about atheism, therefore, but in riotous discord about
many other things, chief among which was the propriety,
the necessity, of doing something to replenish
his balance at the banker. For he was now impecunious,
and withal importunate. Of a truth, what I had
I was always ready to share with him; but for his
own good I advised him to take up the peddling-box
again. I reminded him of his saying once, &#8216;Peddling
is a healthy and profitable business.&#8217; &#8216;Come out,&#8217; I
insisted, &#8216;and though it be for the exercise. Walking
is the whetstone of thought.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;One evening we quarrelled about this, and Im-Hanna
sided with me. She rated Khalid, saying,
&#8216;You&#8217;re a good-for-nothing loafer; you don&#8217;t deserve
the <i>mojadderah</i> you eat.&#8217; And I remember how she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
took me aside that evening and whispered something
about books, and Khalid&#8217;s head, and Mar-Kizhayiah.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
Indeed, Im-Hanna seriously believed that Khalid
should be taken to Mar-Kizhayiah. She did not know
that New York was full of such institutions.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> Her
scolding, however, seemed to have more effect on
Khalid than my reasoning. And consenting to go out
with me, he got up the following morning, took down
his stock from the shelf, every little article of it&ndash;&ndash;he
left nothing there&ndash;&ndash;and packed all into his peddling-box.
He then squeezed into the bottom drawer, which
he had filled with scapulars, the bottle with a little of
the Stuff in it. For we were in accord about this, that
in New York whiskey is better than arak. And we
both took a nip now and then. So I thought the bottle
was in order. But why he placed his bank book, which
was no longer worth a straw, into that bottom drawer,
I could not guess. With these preparations, however,
we shouldered our boxes, and in an hour we
were in the suburbs. We foot it along then, until we
reach a row of cottages not far from the railway station.
&#8216;Will you knock at one of these doors,&#8217; I asked.
And he, &#8216;I do not feel like chaffering and bargaining
this morning.&#8217; &#8216;Why then did you come out,&#8217; I
urged. And he, in an air of nonchalance, &#8216;Only for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
the walk.&#8217; And so, we pursued our way in the Bronx,
until we reached one of our favourite spots, where a
sycamore tree seemed to invite us to its ample shade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Khalid, absent-minded, laid down his box
and sat upon it, and I stretched my limbs on the grass.
But of a sudden, he jumped up, opened the bottom
drawer of his case, and drew from it the bottle. It is
quite in order now, I mused; but ere I had enjoyed the
thought, Khalid had placed his box at a little distance,
and, standing there beside it, bottle in hand, delivered
himself in a semi-solemn, semi-mocking manner of the
following: &#8216;This is the oil,&#8217; I remember him saying,
&#8216;with which I anoint thee&ndash;&ndash;the extreme unction I
apply to thy soul.&#8217; And he poured the contents of the
bottle into the bottom drawer and over the box, and
applied to it a match. The bottle was filled with
kerosene, and in a jiffy the box was covered with the
flame. Yes; and so quickly, so neatly it was done,
that I could not do aught to prevent it. The match
was applied to what I thought at first was whiskey,
and I was left in speechless amazement. He would
not even help me to save a few things from the fire.
I conjured him in the name of Allah, but in vain. I
clamoured and remonstrated, but to no purpose. And
when I asked him why he had done this, he asked me
in reply, &#8216;And why have you not done the same?
Now, methinks I deserve my <i>mojadderah</i>. And not
until you do likewise, will you deserve yours, O
Shakib. Here are the lies, now turned to ashes, which
brought me my bread and are still bringing you yours.
Here are our instruments of deception, our poisoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
sources of lucre. I am most happy now, O Shakib.
And I shall endeavour to keep my blood in circulation
by better, purer means.&#8217; And he took me thereupon
by the shoulders, looked into my face, then pushed me
away, laughing the laugh of the hasheesh-smokers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Im-Hanna was right. Khalid had become
too odd, too queer to be sane. Needless to say, I was
not prone to follow his example at that time. Nor am
I now. <i>Mashallah!</i> Lacking the power and madness
to set fire to the whole world, it were folly, indeed,
to begin with one&#8217;s self. I believe I had as much
right to exaggerate in peddling as I had in writing
verse. My license to heighten the facts holds good in
either case. And to some extent, every one, a poet
be he or a cobbler, enjoys such a license. I told
Khalid that the logical and most effective course to
pursue, in view of his rigorous morality, would be to
pour a gallon of kerosene over his own head and fire
himself out of existence. For the instruments of deception
and debasement are not in the peddling-box,
but rather in his heart. No; I did not think peddling
was as bad as other trades. Here at least, the means
of deception were reduced to a minimum. And of a
truth, if everybody were to judge themselves as strictly
as Khalid, who would escape burning? So I turned
from him that day fully convinced that my little stock
of holy goods was innocent, and my balance at the
banker&#8217;s was as pure as my rich neighbour&#8217;s. And he
turned from me fully convinced, I believe, that I was
an unregenerate rogue. Ay, and when I was knocking
at the door of one of my customers, he was walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
away briskly, his hands clasped behind his back,
and his eyes, as usual, scouring the horizon.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on that horizon are the gilded domes and smoking
chimneys of the seething city. Leaving his last
friend and his last burden behind, he will give civilised
life another trial. Loafer and tramp that he is! For
even the comforts of the grand cable-railway he spurns,
and foots it from the Bronx down to his cellar near
Battery Park, thus cutting the city in half and giving
one portion to Izr&auml;il and the other to Iblis. But not
being quite ready himself for either of these winged
Furies, he keeps to his cellar. He would tarry here a
while, if but to carry out a resolution he has made.
True, Khalid very seldom resolves upon anything; but
when he does make a resolution, he is even willing to
be carried off by the effort to carry it out. And now,
he would solve this problem of earning a living in the
great city by honest means. For in the city, at least,
success well deserves the compliments which those who
fail bestow upon it. What Montaigne said of greatness,
therefore, Khalid must have said of success. If
we can not attain it, let us denounce it. And in what
terms does he this, O merciful Allah! We translate
a portion of the apostrophe in the K. L. MS., and
not the bitterest, by any means.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Success,&#8221; the infuriated failure exclaims, &#8220;how
like the Gorgon of the Arabian Nights thou art! For
does not every one whom thou favorest undergo a pitiful
transformation even from the first bedding with
thee? Does not everything suffer from thy look, thy
touch, thy breath? The rose loses its perfume, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
grape-vine its clusters, the bulbul its wings, the dawn
its light and glamour. O Success, our lords of power
to-day are thy slaves, thy helots, our kings of wealth.
Every one grinds for thee, every one for thee lives and
dies.... Thy palaces of silver and gold are
reared on the souls of men. Thy throne is mortised
with their bones, cemented with their blood. Thou
ravenous Gorgon, on what bankruptcies thou art fed,
on what failures, on what sorrows! The railroads
sweeping across the continents and the steamers ploughing
through the seas, are laden with sacrifices to thee.
Ay, and millions of innocent children are torn from
their homes and from their schools to be offered to
thee at the sacrificial-stone of the Factories and Mills.
The cultured, too, and the wise, are counted among
thy slaves. Even the righteous surrender themselves
to thee and are willing to undergo that hideous transformation.
O Success, what an infernal litany thy
votaries and high-priests are chanting to thee....
Thou ruthless Gorgon, what crimes thou art committing,
and what crimes are being committed in thy
name!&#8221;</p>
<p>From which it is evident that Khalid does not wish
for success. Khalid is satisfied if he can maintain his
hold on the few spare feet he has in the cellar, and continue
to replenish his little store of lentils and olive oil.
For he would as lief be a victim of success, he assures
us, as to forego his <i>mojadderah</i>. And still having this,
which he considers a luxury, he is willing to turn his
hand at anything, if he can but preserve inviolate the
integrity of his soul and the freedom of his mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
These are a few of the pet terms of Khalid. And in
as much as he can continue to repeat them to himself,
he is supremely content. He can be a menial, if while
cringing before his superiors, he were permitted to
chew on his pet illusions. A few days before he
burned his peddling-box, he had read Epictetus. And
the thought that such a great soul maintained its
purity, its integrity, even in bonds, encouraged and
consoled him. &#8220;How can they hurt me,&#8221; he asks, &#8220;if
spiritually I am far from them, far above them?
They can do no more than place gilt buttons on my
coat and give me a cap to replace this slouch. Therefore,
I will serve. I will be a slave, even like Epictetus.&#8221;</p>
<p>And here we must interpose a little of our skepticism,
if but to gratify an habitual craving in us. We
do not doubt that Khalid&#8217;s self-sufficiency is remarkable;
that his courage&ndash;&ndash;on paper&ndash;&ndash;is quite above the
common; that the grit and stay he shows are wonderful;
that his lofty aspirations, so indomitable in their
onwardness, are great: but we only ask, having thus
fortified his soul, how is he to fortify his stomach?
He is going to work, to be a menial, to earn a living
by honest means? Ah, Khalid, Khalid! Did you not
often bestow a furtive glance on some one else&#8217;s checkbook?
Did you not even exercise therein your skill in
calculation? If the bank, where Shakib deposits his
little saving, failed, would you be so indomitable, so
dogged in your resolution? Would you not soften a
trifle, loosen a whit, if only for the sake of your blood-circulation?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>Indeed, Shakib has become a patron to Khalid.
Shakib the poet, who himself should have a patron, is
always ready to share his last dollar with his loving,
though cantankerous friend. And this, in spite of
all the disagreeable features of a friendship which in
the Syrian Colony was become proverbial. But
Khalid now takes up the newspapers and scans the
Want Columns for hours. The result being a clerkship
in a lawyer&#8217;s office. Nay, an apprenticeship; for
the legal profession, it seems, had for a while engaged
his serious thoughts.</p>
<p>And this of all the professions is the one on which
he would graft his scion of lofty morality? Surely,
there be plenty of fuel for a conflagration in a lawyer&#8217;s
office. Such rows of half-calf tomes, such piles of
legal documents, all designed to combat dishonesty and
fraud, &#8220;and all immersed in them, and nourished and
maintained by them.&#8221; In what a sorry condition will
your Morality issue out of these bogs! A lawyer&#8217;s
clerk, we are informed, can not maintain his hold on
his clerkship, if he does not learn to blink. That is
why Khalid is not long in serving papers, copying
summonses, and searching title-deeds. In this lawyer&#8217;s
office he develops traits altogether foreign to his nature.
He even becomes a quidnunc, prying now and then
into the personal affairs of his superiors. Ay, and he
dares once to suggest to his employer a new method of
dealing with the criminals among his clients. Withal,
Khalid is slow, slower than the law itself. If he goes
out to serve a summons he does not return for a day.
If he is sent to search title-deeds, he does not show up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
in the office for a week. And often he would lose
himself in the Park surrounding the Register&#8217;s Office,
pondering on his theory of immanent morality. He
would sit down on one of those benches, which are the
anchors of loafers of another type, his batch of papers
beside him, and watch the mad crowds coming and
going, running, as it were, between two fires. These
puckered people are the living, moving chambers of
sleeping souls.</p>
<p>Khalid was always glad to come to this Register&#8217;s
Office. For though the searching of title-deeds be a
mortal process, the loafing margin of the working hour
could be extended imperceptibly, and without hazarding
his or his employer&#8217;s interest. The following
piece of speculative fantasy and insight must have been
thought out when he should have been searching title-deeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Register&#8217;s Office,&#8221; it is written in the K. L.
MS., &#8220;is the very bulwark of Society. It is the foundation
on which the Trust Companies, the Courts, and
the Prisons are reared. Your codes are blind without
the miraculous torches which this Office can light.
Your judges can not propound the &#8216;laur&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I beg your
pardon, the law&ndash;&ndash;without the aid of these musty,
smelling, dilapidated tomes. Ay, these are the very
constables of the realm, and without them there can
be no realm, no legislators, and no judges. Strong,
club-bearing constables, these Liebers, standing on the
boundary lines, keeping peace between brothers and
neighbours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, in these Liebers is an authority which never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
fails, never dies&ndash;&ndash;an authority which willy-nilly we
obey and in which we place unbounded trust. In any
one of these Registers is a potentiality which can always
worst the quibbles and quiddities of lawyers and ward
off the miserable technicalities of the law. Any of
them, when called upon, can go into court and dictate
to the litigants and the attorneys, the jury and the
judge. They are the deceased witnesses come to life.
And without them, the judges are helpless, the marshals
and sheriffs too. Ay, and what without them would
be the state of our real-estate interests? Abolish your
constabulary force, and your police force, and with
these muniments of power, these dumb but far-seeing
agents of authority and intelligence, you could still
maintain peace and order. But burn you this Register&#8217;s
Office, and before the last Lieber turn to ashes,
ere the last flame of the conflagration die out, you will
have to call forth, not only your fire squads, but your
police force and even your soldiery, to extinguish other
fires different in nature, but more devouring&ndash;&ndash;and as
many of them as there are boundary lines in the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we now come to the gist of the matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What wealth of moral truth,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;do we find
in these greasy, musty pages. When one deeds a piece of
property, he deeds with it something more valuable, more
enduring. He deeds with it an undying human intelligence
which goes down to posterity, saying, Respect my will; believe
in me; and convey this respect and this belief to your
offspring. Ay, the immortal soul breathes in a deed as in a
great book. And the implicit trust we place in a musty
parchment, is the mystic outcome of the blind faith, or rather
the far-seeing faith which our ancestors had in the morality
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
and intelligence of coming generations. For what avails
their deeds if they are not respected?... We are indebted
to our forbears, therefore, not for the miserable piece
of property they bequeath us, but for the confidence and
trust, the faith and hope they had in our innate or immanent
morality and intelligence. The will of the dead is law for
the living.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are we then to look upon Khalid as having come
out of that Office with soiled fingers only? Or has
the young philosopher abated in his clerkship the intensity
of his moral views? Has he not assisted his
employer in the legal game of quieting titles? Has he
not acquired a little of the delusive plausibilities of
lawyers? Shakib throws no light on these questions.
We only know that the clerkship or rather apprenticeship
was only held for a season. Indeed, Khalid must
have recoiled from the practice. Or in his recklessness,
not to say obtrusion, he must have been outrageous
enough to express in the office of the honourable
attorney, or in the neighbourhood thereof, his views
about pettifogging and such like, that the said honourable
attorney was under the painful necessity of asking
him to stay home. Nay, the young Syrian was discharged.
Or to put it in a term adequate to the manner
in which this was done, he was &#8220;fired.&#8221; Now,
Khalid betakes him back to his cellar, and thrumming
his lute-strings, lights up the oppressive gloom with
Arabic song and music.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>WITH THE HURIS</h3>
</div>
<p>From the house of law the dervish Khalid wends
his way to that of science, and from the house of
science he passes on to that of metaphysics. His staff
in hand, his wallet hung on his shoulder, his silver
cigarette case in his pocket, patient, confident, content,
he makes his way from one place to another. Unlike
his brother dervishes, he is clean and proud of it, too.
He knocks at this or that door, makes his wish known
to the servant or the mistress, takes the crumbs given
him, and not infrequently gives his prod to the dogs.
In the vestibule of one of the houses of spiritism, he
tarries a spell and parleys with the servant. The Mistress,
a fair-looking, fair-spoken dame of seven lustrums
or more, issues suddenly from her studio, in a
curiously designed black velvet dressing-gown; she is
drawn to the door by the accent of the foreigner&#8217;s
speech and the peculiar cadence of his voice. They
meet: and magnetic currents from his dark eyes and
her eyes of blue, flow and fuse. They speak: and the
lady asks the stranger if he would not serve instead
of begging. And he protests, &#8220;I am a Dervish at
the door of Allah.&#8221; &#8220;And I am a Spirit in Allah&#8217;s
house,&#8221; she rejoins. They enter: and the parley in
the vestibule is followed by a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te in the parlour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
and another in the dining-room. They agree: and the
stranger is made a member of the Spiritual Household,
which now consists of her and him, the Medium and
the Dervish.</p>
<p>Now, this fair-spoken dame, who dotes on the occult
and exotic, delights in the aroma of Khalid&#8217;s cigarettes
and Khalid&#8217;s fancy. And that he might feel at ease,
she begins by assuring him that they have met and
communed many times ere now, that they have been
friends under a preceding and long vanished embodiment.
Which vagary Khalid seems to countenance by
referring to the infinite power of Allah, in the compass
of which nothing is impossible. And with these
mystical circumlocutions of ceremony, they plunge into
an intimacy which is bordered by the metaphysical on
one side, and the physical on the other. For though
the Medium is at the threshold of her climacteric,
Khalid afterwards tells Shakib that there be something
in her eyes and limbs which always seem to be waxing
young. And of a truth, the American woman, of all
others, knows best how to preserve her beauty from
the ravages of sorrow and the years. That is why,
we presume, in calling him, &#8220;child,&#8221; she does not permit
him to call her, &#8220;mother.&#8221; Indeed, the Medium
and the Dervish often jest, and somewhiles mix the
frivolous with the mysterious.</p>
<p>We would still follow our Scribe here, were it not
that his pruriency often reaches the edge. He speaks
of &#8220;the <i>liaison</i>&#8221; with all the rude simplicity and frankness
of the Arabian Nights. And though, as the Mohammedans
say, &#8220;To the pure everything is pure,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
again, &#8220;Who quotes a heresy is not guilty of it&#8221;;
nevertheless, we do not feel warranted in rending the
veil of the reader&#8217;s prudery, no matter how transparent
it might be. We believe, however, that the pruriency
of Orientals, like the prudery of Occidentals, is in fact
only an appearance. On both sides there is a display
of what might be called verbal virtue and verbal vice.
And on both sides, the exaggerations are configured in
a harmless pose. Be this as it may, we at least, shall
withhold from Shakib&#8217;s lasciviousness the English
dress it seeks at our hand.</p>
<p>We note, however, that Khalid now visits him in
the cellar only when he craves a dish of <i>mojadderah</i>;
that he and the Medium are absorbed in the contemplation
of the Unseen, though not, perhaps, of the Impalpable;
that they gallivant in the Parks, attend Bohemian
dinners, and frequent the Don&#8217;t Worry Circles
of Metaphysical Societies; that they make long expeditions
together to the Platonic North-pole and back
to the torrid regions of Swinburne; and that together
they perform their <i>zikr</i> and drink at the same fountain
of ecstasy and devotion. Withal, the Dervish, who
now wears his hair long and grows his finger nails
like a Brahmin, is beginning to have some manners.</p>
<p>The Medium, nevertheless, withholds from him
the secret of her art. If he desires, he can attend the
s&eacute;ances like every other stranger. Once Khalid, who
would not leave anything unprobed, insisted, importuned;
he could not see any reason for her conduct.
Why should they not work together in Tiptology, as
in Physiology and Metaphysics? And one morning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
dervish-like, he wraps himself in his <i>aba</i>, and, calling
upon Allah to witness, takes a rose from the vase on
the table, angrily plucks its petals, and strews them on
the carpet. Which portentous sign the Medium understands
and hastens to minister her palliatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Child, you shall not go,&#8221; she begs and supplicates;
&#8220;listen to me, are we not together all the time?
Why not leave me alone then with the spirits? One
day you shall know all, believe me. Come, sit here,&#8221;
stroking her palm on her lap, &#8220;and listen. I shall
give up this tiptology business very soon; you and I
shall overturn the table. Yes, Child, I am on the
point of succumbing under an awful something. So,
don&#8217;t ask me about the spooks any more. Promise not
to torment me thus any more. And one day we shall
travel together in the Orient; we shall visit the ruins
of vanished kingdoms and creeds. Ah, to be in
Palmyra with you! Do you know, Child, I am destined
to be a Beduin queen. The throne of Zenobia
is mine, and yours too, if you will be good. We shall
resuscitate the glory of the kingdom of the desert.&#8221;</p>
<p>To all of which Khalid acquiesces by referring as is
his wont to the infinite wisdom of Allah, in whose all-seeing
eye nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>And thus, apparently satisfied, he takes the cigarette
which she had lighted for him, and lights for her another
from his own. But the smoke of two cigarettes
dispels not the threatening cloud; it only conceals it
from view. For they dine together at a Bohemian
Club that evening, where Khalid meets a woman of
rare charms. And she invites him to her studio. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Medium, who is at first indifferent, finally warns her
callow child. &#8220;That woman is a writer,&#8221; she explains,
&#8220;and writers are always in search of what they
call &#8216;copy.&#8217; She in particular is a huntress of male
curiosities, <i>originales</i>, whom she takes into her favour
and ultimately surrenders them to the reading public.
So be careful.&#8221; But Khalid hearkens not. For the
writer, whom he afterwards calls a flighter, since she,
too, &#8220;like the van of the brewer only skims the surface
of things,&#8221; is, in fact, younger than the Medium. Ay,
this woman is even beautiful&ndash;&ndash;to behold, at least.
So the Dervish, a captive of her charms, knocks at the
door of her studio one evening and enters. Ah, this
then is a studio! &#8220;I am destined to know everything,
and to see everything,&#8221; he says to himself, smiling in
his heart.</p>
<p>The charming hostess, in a Japanese kimono receives
him somewhat orientally, offering him the divan,
which he occupies alone for a spell. He is then laden
with a huge scrap-book containing press notices and
reviews of her many novels. These, he is asked to go
through while she prepares the tea. Which is a mortal
task for the Dervish in the presence of the Enchantress.
Alas, the tea is long in the making, and
when the scrap-book is laid aside, she reinforces him
with a lot of magazines adorned with stories of the
short and long and middling size, from her fertile pen.
&#8220;These are beautiful,&#8221; says he, in glancing over a
few pages, &#8220;but no matter how you try, you can not
with your pen surpass your own beauty. The charm
of your literary style can not hold a candle to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
charm of your&ndash;&ndash;permit me to read your hand.&#8221;
And laying down the magazine, he takes up her hand
and presses it to his lips. In like manner, he tries to
read somewhat in the face, but the Enchantress protests
and smiles. In which case the smile renders the
protest null and void.</p>
<p>Henceforth, the situation shall be trying even to
the Dervish who can eat live coals. He oscillates for
some while between the Medium and the Enchantress,
but finds the effort rather straining. The first climax,
however, is reached, and our Scribe thinks it too sad
for words. He himself sheds a few rheums with the
fair-looking, fair-spoken Dame, and dedicates to her a
few rhymes. Her magnanimity, he tells us, is unexampled,
and her fatalism pathetic. For when Khalid
severs himself from the Spiritual Household, she kisses
him thrice, saying, &#8220;Go, Child; Allah brought you to
me, and Allah will bring you again.&#8221; Khalid refers,
as usual, to the infinite wisdom of the Almighty, and,
taking his handkerchief from his pocket, wipes the
tears that fell&ndash;&ndash;from her eyes over his. He passes
out of the vestibule, silent and sad, musing on the
time he first stood there as a beggar.</p>
<p>Now, the horizon of the Enchantress is unobstructed.
Khalid is there alone; and her free love
can freely pass on from him to another. And such
messages they exchange! Such evaporations of the insipidities
of free love! Khalid again takes up with
Shakib, from whom he does not conceal anything.
The epistles are read by both, and sometimes replied to
by both! And she, in an effort to seem Oriental, calls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the Dervish, &#8220;My Syrian Rose,&#8221; &#8220;My Desert
Flower,&#8221; &#8220;My Beduin Boy,&#8221; et cetera, always closing
her message with either a strip of Syrian sky
or a camel load of the narcissus. Ah, but not thus
will the play close. True, Khalid alone adorns
her studio for a time, or rather adores in it;
he alone accompanies her to Bohemia. But the Dervish,
who was always going wrong in Bohemia,&ndash;&ndash;always
at the door of the Devil,&ndash;&ndash;ventures one night
to escort another woman to her studio. Ah, those
studios! The Enchantress on hearing of the crime
lights the fire under her cauldron. &#8220;Double, double,
toil and trouble!&#8221; She then goes to the telephone&ndash;&ndash;g-r-r-r-r
you swine&ndash;&ndash;you Ph&oelig;nician murex&ndash;&ndash;she
hangs up the receiver, and stirs the cauldron.
&#8220;Double, double, toil and trouble!&#8221; But the Dervish
writes her an extraordinary letter, in which we suspect
the pen of our Scribe, and from which we can but
transcribe the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You found in me a vacant heart,&#8221; he pleads, &#8220;and you
occupied it. The divan therein is yours, yours alone. Nor
shall I ever permit a chance caller, an intruder, to exasperate
you.... My breast is a stronghold in which you
are well fortified. How then can any one disturb you?...
How can I turn from myself against myself? Somewhat
of you, the best of you, circulates with my blood; you
are my breath of life. How can I then overcome you? How
can I turn to another for the sustenance which you alone can
give?... If I be thirst personified, you are the living,
flowing brook, the everlasting fountain. O for a drink&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here follows a hectic uprush about pearly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
breasts, and honey-sources, and musk-scented arbours,
closing with &#8220;Your Beduin Boy shall come to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding which, the Enchantress abandons
the Syrian Dwelling: she no longer fancies the vacant
Divan of which Khalid speaks. Fortress or no
fortress, she gives up occupation and withdraws from
the foreigner her favour. Not only that; but the fire is
crackling under the cauldron, and the typewriter begins
to click. Ay, these modern witches can make
even a typewriter dance around the fire and join in
the chorus. &#8220;Double, double, toil and trouble, Fire
burn, and cauldron bubble!&#8221; and the performance
was transformed from the studio to the magazine
supplement of one of the Sunday newspapers. There,
the Dervish is thrown into the cauldron along with the
magic herbs. Bubble&ndash;&ndash;bubble. The fire-eating
Dervish, how can he now swallow this double-tongued
flame of hate and love? The Enchantress
had wrought her spell, had ministered her poison.
Now, where can he find an antidote, who can teach
him a healing formula? Bruno D&#8217;Ast was once bewitched
by a sorceress, and by causing her to be
burned he was immediately cured. Ah, that Khalid
could do this! Like an ordinary pamphlet he would
consign the Enchantress to the flames, and her scrap-books
and novels to boot. He does well, however, to
return to his benevolent friend, the Medium. The
spell can be counteracted by another, though less potent.
Ay, even witchcraft has its homeopathic remedies.</p>
<p>And the Medium, Shakib tells us, is delighted to
welcome back her prodigal child. She opens to him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
her arms, and her heart; she slays the fatted calf. &#8220;I
knew that Allah will bring you back to me,&#8221; she ejaculates;
&#8220;my prevision is seldom wrong.&#8221; And kissing
her hand, Khalid falters, &#8220;Forgiveness is for the sinner,
and the good are for forgiveness.&#8221; Whereupon,
they plunge again into the Unseen, and thence to
Bohemia. The aftermath, however, does not come up
to the expectations of the good Medium. For the
rigmarole of the Enchantress about the Dervish in
New York had already done its evil work. And&ndash;&ndash;double&ndash;&ndash;double&ndash;&ndash;wherever
the Dervish goes.
Especially in Bohemia, where many of its daughters
set their caps for him.</p>
<p>And here, he is neither shy nor slow nor visionary.
Nor shall his theory of immanent morality trouble
him for the while. Reality is met with reality on
solid, though sometimes slippery, ground. His animalism,
long leashed and starved, is eager for prey.
His Ph&oelig;nician passion is awake. And fortunately,
Khalid finds himself in Bohemia where the poison and
the antidote are frequently offered together. Here
the spell of one sorceress can straightway be offset by
that of her sister. And we have our Scribe&#8217;s word
for it, that the Dervish went as far and as deep with
the huris, as the doctors eventually would permit him.
That is why, we believe, in commenting upon his adventures
there, he often quotes the couplet,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>In my sublunar paradise<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>There&#8217;s plenty of honey&ndash;&ndash;and plenty of flies.&#8221;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>The flies in his cup, however, can not be detected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
with the naked eye. They are microbes rather&ndash;&ndash;microbes
which even the physicians can not manage
with satisfaction. For it must be acknowledged that
Khalid&#8217;s immanent morality and intellectualism suffered
an interregnum with the huris. Reckless,
thoughtless, heartless, he plunges headlong again.
It is said in Al-Hadith that he who guards
himself against the three cardinal evils, namely, of
the tongue (<i>laklaka</i>), of the stomach (<i>kabkaba</i>), and
of the sex (<i>zabzaba</i>), will have guarded himself
against all evil. But Khalid reads not in the Hadith
of the Prophet. And that he became audacious, edacious,
and loquacious, is evident from such wit and
flippancy as he here likes to display. &#8220;Some women,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;might be likened to whiskey, others to
seltzer water; and many are those who, like myself,
care neither for the soda or the whiskey straight. A
&#8216;high-ball&#8217; I will have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nay, he even takes to punch; for in his cup of
amour there is a subtle and multifarious mixture.
With him, he himself avows, one woman complemented
another. What the svelte brunette, for instance,
lacked, the steatopygous blonde amply supplied.
Delicacy and intensity, effervescence and depth, these
he would have in a woman, or a hareem, as in anything
else. But these excellences, though found in a hareem,
will not fuse, as in a poem or a picture. Even thy
bones, thou scented high-lacquered Dervish, are likely
to melt away before they melt into one.</p>
<p>It is written in the K. L. MS. that women either
bore, or inspire, or excite. &#8220;The first and the last are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
to be met with anywhere; but the second? Ah, well
you have heard the story of Diogenes. So take up
your lamp and come along. But remember, when
you do meet the woman that inspires, you will begin
to yearn for the woman that excites.&#8221;</p>
<p>And here, the hospitality of the Dervish does not belie
his Arab blood. In Bohemia, the bonfire of his
heart was never extinguished, and the wayfarers stopping
before his tent, be they of those who bored, or excited,
or inspired, were welcome guests for at least
three days and nights. And in this he follows the rule
of hospitality among his people.</p>

whether as a child of thy womb, or an embodiment

personification of thy smiles and tears, or an ignis-fatuus
of the intelligence that is in thee or beyond thee,
I am thine forever and ever: I come to thee, I prostrate

lull me in thine autumn sun-downs to teach me in the

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE DOWRY OF DEMOCRACY</h3>
</div>
<p>Old Arabic books, printed in <ins class="trchange" title="Added comma">Bulaq,</ins> generally
have a broad margin wherein a separate work,
independent of the text, adds gloom to the page. We
have before us one of these tomes in which the text
treats of the ethics of life and religion, and the margins
are darkened with certain adventures which
Shahrazad might have added to her famous Nights.
The similarity between Khalid&#8217;s life in its present
stage and some such book, is evident. Nay, he has
been so assiduous in writing the marginal Work, that
ever since he set fire to his peddling-box, we have had
little in the Text worth transcribing. Nothing, in
fact; for many pages back are as blank as the evil genius
of Bohemia could wish them. And how could one
with that mara upon him, write of the ethics of life
and religion?</p>
<p>Al-Hamazani used to say that in Jorajan the man
from Khorasan must open thrice his purse: first, to pay
for the rent; second, for the food; and third, for his
coffin. And so, in Khalid&#8217;s case, at least, is Bohemia.
For though the purse be not his own, he was paying
dear, and even in advance, in what is dearer than
gold, for his experience. &#8220;O, that the Devil did
not take such interest in the marginal work of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
life! Why should we write it then, and for whom?
And how will it fare with us when, chapfallen in the
end and mortified, we stand before the great Task-Master
like delinquent school boys with a blank text
in our hands?&#8221; (Thus Shakib, who has caught the
moralising evil from his Master.) And that we must
stand, and fall, for thus standing, he is quite certain.
At least, Khalid is. For he would not return to the
Text to make up for the blank pages therein, if he were
not.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he returned from his last sojourn in Bohemia,&#8221;
writes our Scribe, &#8220;Khalid was pitiful to behold.
Even Sindbad, had he seen him, would have
been struck with wonder. The tears rushed to my
eyes when we embraced; for instead of Khalid I had in
my arms a phantom. And I could not but repeat the

he replied, &#8220;Yes, one more; but to our dear native land
this time.&#8221; In fact, I, too, was beginning to suffer
from nostalgia, and was much desirous of returning
home.&#8221; But Shakib is in such a business tangle that
he could not extricate himself in a day. So, they
tarry another year in New York, the one meanwhile
unravelling his affairs, settling with his creditors and
collecting what few debts he had, the other brooding
over the few blank pages in his Text.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>One day he receives a letter from a fellow traveller,
a distinguished citizen of Tammany Land, whom he
had met and befriended in Bohemia, relating to an
enterprise of great pith and moment. It was election
time, we learn, and the high post of political canvasser
of the Syrian District was offered to Khalid for
a consideration of&ndash;&ndash;but the letter which Shakib happily
preserved, we give in full.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Dear Khalid:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have succeeded in getting Mr. O&#8217;Donohue to appoint
you a canvasser of the Syrian District. You must stir yourself,
therefore, and try to do some good work, among the
Syrian voters, for Democracy&#8217;s Candidate this campaign.
Here is a chance which, with a little hustling on your part,
will materialise. And I see no reason why you should not
try to cash your influence among your people. This is no
mean position, mind you. And if you will come up to the
Wigwam to-morrow, I&#8217;ll give you a few suggestions on the
business of manipulating votes.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:5.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 3.90625em;'>&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />
&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Patrick Hoolihan</span>.&#8221;<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the said Mr. Hoolihan, the letter shows, is
Secretary to Mr. O&#8217;Donohue, who is first henchman to
the Boss. Such a letter, if luckily misunderstood, will
fire for a while the youthful imagination. No; not
his Shamrag Majesty&#8217;s Tammany Agent to Syria,
this Canvassership, you poor phantom-like zany! A
high post, indeed, you fond and pitiful dreamer, on
which you must hang the higher aspirations of your
soul, together with your theory of immanent morality.
You would not know this at first. You would still
kiss the official notification of Mr. Hoolihan, and hug
it fondly to your breast. Very well. At last&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
the gods will not damn thee for musing&ndash;&ndash;you will
stand in the band-wagon before the corner groggery
and be the object of the admiration of your fellow citizens&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
of missiles, too. Very well, Khalid;
but you must shear that noddle of thine, and straightway,
for the poets are potted in Tammany Land. We
say this for your sake.</p>
<p>The orator-dream of youth, ye gods, shall it be
realised in this heaven of a dray-cart with its kerosene
torch and its drum, smelling and sounding rather
of Juhannam? Surely, from the Table of Bohemia
to the Stump in Tammany Land, is a far cry. But believe
us, O Khalid, you will wish you were again in
the gardens of Proserpine, when the silence and darkness
extinguish the torch and the drum and the echoes
of the shouting crowds. The headaches are certain
to follow this inebriation. You did not believe
Shakib; you would not be admonished; you would go
to the Wigwam for your portfolio. &#8220;<i>High post</i>,&#8221;
&#8220;<i>political canvasser</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>manipulation of votes</i>,&#8221; you
will know the exact meaning of these esoteric terms,
when, alas, you meet Mr. Hoolihan. For you must
know that not every one you meet in Bohemia is not a
Philistine. Indeed, many helots are there, who come
from Philistia to spy out the Land.</p>
<p>We read in the <i>Histoire Intime</i> of Shakib that
Khalid did become a Tammany citizen, that is to say,
a Tammany dray-horse; that he was much esteemed
by the Honourable Henchmen, and once in the Wigwam
he was particularly noticed by his Shamrag
Majesty Boss O&#8217;Graft; that he was Tammany&#8217;s Agent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
to the Editors of the Syrian newspapers of New York,
whom he enrolled in the service of the Noble Cause
for a consideration which no eloquence or shrewdness
could reduce to a minimum; that he also took to the
stump and dispensed to his fellow citizens, with rhetorical
gestures at least, of the cut-and-dried logic which
the Committee of Buncombe on such occasions
furnishes its squad of talented spouters; and that&ndash;&ndash;the
most important this&ndash;&ndash;he was subject in the end
to the ignominy of waiting in the lobby with tuft-hunters
and political stock-jobbers, until it pleased the
Committee of Buncombe and the Honourable Treasurer
thereof to give him&ndash;&ndash;a card of dismissal!</p>
<p>But what virtue is there in waiting, our cynical
friend would ask. Why not go home and sleep?
Because, O cynical friend, the Wigwam now is
Khalid&#8217;s home. For was he not, in creaking boots
and a slouch hat, ceremoniously married to Democracy?
Ay, and after spending their honeymoon
on the Stump and living another month or two
with his troll among her People, he returns to his
cellar to brood, not over the blank pages in his Text,
nor over the disastrous results of the Campaign, but
on the weightier matter of divorce. For although
Politics and Romance, in the History of Human Intrigue,
have often known and enjoyed the same yoke,
with Khalid they refused to pull at the plough. They
were not sensible even to the goad. Either the yoke
in his case was too loose, or the new yoke-fellow too
thick-skinned and stubborn.</p>
<p>Moreover, the promise of a handsome dowry, made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
by the Shamrag Father-in-Law or his Brokers materialised
only in the rotten eggs and tomatoes with which
the Orator was cordially received on his honeymoon
trip. Such a marriage, O Mohammad, and such a
honeymoon, and such a dowry!&ndash;&ndash;is not this enough
to shake the very sides of the Kaaba with laughter?
And yet, in the Wigwam this not uncommon affair
was indifferently considered; for the good and honourable
Tammanyites marry off their Daughters every
day to foreigners and natives alike, and with like extraordinary
picturesque results.</p>
<p>Were it not wiser, therefore, O Khalid, had you
consulted your friend the Dictionary before you saw
exact meaning of canvass and manipulation, before
you put on your squeaking boots and slouch hat and
gave your hand and heart to Tammany&#8217;s Daughter
and her Father-in-Law O&#8217;Graft? But the Dictionary,
too, often falls short of human experience; and
even Mr. O&#8217;Donohue could at best but hint at the
meaning of the esoteric terms of Tammany&#8217;s political
creed. These you must define for yourself as you go
along; and change and revise your definitions as you
rise or descend in the Sacred Order. For canvass here
might mean eloquence; there it might mean shrewdness;
lower down, intimidation and coercion; and further
depthward, human sloth and misery. It is but a
common deal in horses. Ay, in Tammany Land it is
essentially a trade honestly conducted on the known
principle of supply and demand. These truths you
had to discover for yourself, you say; for neither the
Dictionary, nor your friend and fellow traveller in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
Bohemia, Mr. Hoolihan, could stretch their knowledge
or their conscience to such a compass. And
you are not sorry to have made such a discovery?
Can you think of the Dowry and say that? We are,
indeed, sorry for you. And we would fain insert in
letter D of the Dictionary a new definition: namely,
Dowry, n. (Tammany Land Slang). The odoriferous
missiles, such as eggs and tomatoes, which are
showered on an Orator-Groom by the people.</p>
<p>But see what big profits Khalid draws from these
small shares in the Reality Stock Company. You remember,
good Reader, how he was kicked away from
the door of the Temple of Atheism. The stogies of
that inspired Doorkeeper were divine, according to his
way of viewing things, for they were at that particular
moment God&#8217;s own boots. Ay, it was God, he
often repeats, who kicked him away from the Temple
of his enemies. And now, he finds the Dowry of
Democracy, with all its wonderful revelations, as
profitable in its results, as divine in its purpose. And
in proof of this, we give here a copy of his letter to
Boss O&#8217;Graft, written in that downright manner of
his contemporaries, the English original of which we
find in the <i>Histoire Intime</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>&#8220;From Khalid to Boss O&#8217;Graft.<br /></p>
<p>&#8220;Right <i>Dis</i>honourable Boss:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just received a check from your Treasurer, which
by no right whatever is due me, having been paid for my
services by Him who knows better than you and your Treasurer
what I deserve. The voice of the people, and their
eggs and tomatoes, too, are, indeed, God&#8217;s. And you should
know this, you who dare to remunerate me in what is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
half as clean as those missiles. I return not your insult of a
check, however; but I have tried to do your state some service
in purchasing the few boxes of soap which I am now
dispatching to the Wigwam. You need more, I know, you
and your Honourable Henchmen or Hashmen. And instead
of canvassing and orating for Democracy&#8217;s illustrious Candidate
and the Noble Cause, <i>mashallah!</i> one ought to do
a little canvassing for Honesty and Truth among Democracy&#8217;s
leaders, tuft-hunters, political stock-jobbers, and such
like. O, for a higher stump, my Boss, to preach to those
who are supporting and degrading the stumps and the stump-orators
of the Republic!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And is it come to this, you poor phantom-like
dreamer? Think you a Tammany Boss is like your
atheists and attorneys and women of the studio, at
whom you could vent your ire without let or hindrance?
These harmless humans have no constables
at their command. But his Shamrag Majesty&ndash;&ndash;O
wretched Khalid, must we bring one of his myrmidons
to your cellar to prove to you that, even in this
Tammany Land, you can not with immunity give free
and honest expression to your thoughts? Now, were
you not summoned to the Shamrag&#8217;s presence to
answer for the crime of <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i>? And were you
not, for your audacity, left to brood ten days and
nights in gaol? And what tedium we have in
Shakib&#8217;s History about the charge on which he was
arrested. It is unconscionable that Khalid should
misappropriate Party funds. Indeed, he never
even touched or saw any of it, excepting, of course, that
check which he returned. But the Boss was still in
power. And what could Shakib do to exonerate his
friend? He did much, and he tells as much about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
With check-boot in his pocket, he makes his way
through aldermen, placemen, henchmen, and other questionable
political species of humanity, up to the Seat of
Justice&ndash;&ndash;but such detail, though of the veracity of the
writer nothing doubting, we gladly set aside, since we
believe with Khalid that his ten days in gaol were akin
to the Boots and the Dowry in their motive and
effect.</p>
<p>But our Scribe, though never remiss when Khalid
is in a pickle, finds much amiss in Khalid&#8217;s thoughts
and sentiments. And as a further illustration of the
limpid shallows of the one and the often opaque
depths of the other, we give space to the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;When Khalid was ordered to appear before the
Boss,&#8221; writes Shakib, &#8220;such curiosity and anxiety as I
felt at that time made me accompany him. For I was
anxious about Khalid, and curious to see this great
Leader of men. We set out, therefore, together, I
musing on an incident in Baalbek when we went out
to meet the Pasha of the Lebanons and a droll old
peasant, having seen him for the first time, cried out,
&#8216;I thought the Pasha to be a Pasha, but he&#8217;s but a
man.&#8217; And I am sorry, after having seen the Boss,
I can not say as much for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here follows a little philosophising, unbecoming of
our Scribe, on men and names and how they act and
react upon each other. Also, a page about his misgivings
and the effort he made to persuade Khalid not
to appear before the Boss. But skipping over these,
&#8220;we reach the Tammany Wigwam and are conducted
by a thick-set, heavy-jowled, heavy-booted citizen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
through the long corridor into a little square room
occupied by a little square-faced clerk. Here we wait
a half hour and more, during which the young
gentleman, with his bell before him and his orders to
minor clerks who come and go, poses as somebody of
some importance. We are then asked to follow him
from one room into another, until we reach the one
adjoining the private office of the Boss. A knock or
two are executed on the door of Greatness with a
nauseous sense of awe, and &#8216;Come in,&#8217; Greatness within
huskily replies. The square-faced clerk enters,
shuts the door after him, returns in a trice, and conducts
us into the awful Presence. Ye gods of Baalbek,
the like of this I never saw before. Here is a
room sumptuously furnished with sofas and fauteuils,
and rugs from Ispahan. On the walls are pictures
of Washington, Jefferson, and the great Boss Tweed;
and right under the last named, behind that preciously
carved mahogany desk, in that soft rolling mahogany
chair, is the squat figure of the big Boss. On the
desk before him, besides a plethora of documents, lay
many things pell-mell, among which I noticed a box of
cigars, the Criminal Code, and, most prominent of all,
the Boss&#8217; feet, raised there either to bid us welcome,
or to remind us of his power. And the rich Ispahan
rug, the cuspidor being small and overfull, receives
the richly coloured matter which he spurts forth every
time he takes the cigar out of his mouth. O, the vulgarity,
the bestiality of it! Think of those poor patient
Persian weavers who weave the tissues of their
hearts into such beautiful work, and of this proud and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
paltry Boss, whose office should have been furnished
with straw. Yes, with straw; and the souls of those
poor artist-weavers will sleep in peace. O, the ignominy
of having such precious pieces of workmanship
under the feet and spittle of such vulgar specimens of
humanity. But if the Boss had purchased these rugs
himself, with money earned by his own brow-sweat,
I am sure he would appreciate them better. He would
then know, if not their intrinsic worth, at least their
market value. Yes, and they were presented to him
by some one <i>needing, I suppose, police connivance
and protection</i>. The first half of this statement I
had from the Boss himself; the second, I base on
Khalid&#8217;s knowingness and suspicion. Be this, however,
as it may.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we entered this sumptuously furnished office,
the squat figure in the chair under the picture of
Boss Tweed, remained as immobile as a fixture and
did not as much as reply to our <i>salaam</i>. But he
pointed disdainfully to seats in the corner of the room,
saying, &#8216;Sit down there,&#8217; in a manner quite in keeping
with his stogies raised on the desk directly in our face.
Such freedom, nay, such bestiality, I could never tolerate.
Indeed, I prefer the suavity and palaver of
Turkish officials, no matter how crafty and corrupt, to
the puffing, spitting manners of these come-up-from-the-shamble
men. But Khalid could sit there as immobile
as the Boss himself, and he did so, billah! For
he was thinking all the while, as he told me when we
came out, not of such matters as grate on the susceptibilities
of a poet, but on the one sole idea of how such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
a bad titman could lead by the nose so many good
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shakib then proceeds to give us a verbatim report of
the interview. It begins with the Boss&#8217; question,
&#8220;What do you mean by writing such a letter?&#8221; and
ends with this other, &#8220;What do you mean by immanent
morality?&#8221; The reader, given the head and tail of the
matter, can supply the missing parts. Or, given its
two bases, he can construct this triangle of Politics,
Ethics, and the Constable, with Khalid&#8217;s letter,
offended Majesty, and a prison cell, as its three turning
points. We extract from the report, however, the
concluding advice of the Boss. For when he asked
Khalid again what he meant by immanent morality, he
continued in a crescendo of indignation: &#8220;You mean
the morality of hayseeds, and priests, and philosophical
fools? That sort of morality will not as much as secure
a vote during the campaign, nor even help to
keep the lowest clerk in office. That sort of morality
is good for your mountain peasants or other barbarous
tribes. But the free and progressive people of the
United States must have something better, nobler,
more practical. You&#8217;d do well, therefore, to get you a
pair of rings, hang them in your ears, and go preach,
your immanent morality to the South African Pappoos.
But before you go, you shall taste of the rigour of our
law, you insolent, brazen-faced, unmannerly scoundrel!&#8221;</p>
<p>And we are assured that the Boss did not remain immobile
as be spurted forth this mixture of wrath and
wisdom, nor did the stogies; for moved by his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
words, he rose promptly to his feet. &#8220;And what of
it,&#8221; exclaims our Scribe. &#8220;Surely, I had rather see
those boots perform any office, high or low, as to behold
their soles raised like mirrors to my face.&#8221; But
how high an office they performed when the Boss came
forward, we are not told. All that our Scribe gives
out about the matter amounts to this: namely, that he
walked out of the room, and as he looked back to see
if Khalid was following, he saw him brushing with his
hands&ndash;&ndash;his hips! And on that very day Khalid was
summoned to appear before the Court and give answer
to the charge of misappropriation of public funds.
The orator-dream of youth&ndash;&ndash;what a realisation!
He comes to Court, and after the legal formalities are
performed, he is delivered unto an officer who escorts
him across the Bridge of Sighs to gaol. There, for
ten days and nights,&ndash;&ndash;and it might have been ten
months were it not for his devoted and steadfast
friend,&ndash;&ndash;we leave Khalid to brood on Democracy and
the Dowry of Democracy. A few extracts from the
Chapter in the K. L. MS. entitled &#8220;In Prison,&#8221; are,
therefore, appropriate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;So long as one has faith,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;in the general
moral summation of the experience of mankind, as the philosophy
of reason assures us, one should not despair. But
the material fact of the Present, the dark moment of no-morality,
consider that, my suffering Brothers. And reflect
further that in this great City of New York the majority of
citizens consider it a blessing to have a <i>rojail</i> (titman) for
their boss and leader.... How often have I mused
that if Ponce de Leon sought the Fountain of Youth in the
New World, I, Khalid, sought the Fountain of Truth, and
both of us have been equally successful!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But the Americans are neither Pagans&ndash;&ndash;which is consoling&ndash;&ndash;nor
fetish-worshipping heathens: they are all true
and honest votaries of Mammon, their great God, their one
and only God. And is it not natural that the Demiurgic
Dollar should be the national Deity of America? Have not
deities been always conceived after man&#8217;s needs and aspirations?
Thus in Egypt, in a locality where the manufacture
of pottery was the chief industry, God was represented as a
potter; in agricultural districts, as a god of harvest; among
warring tribes as an avenger, a Jehovah. And the more
needs, the more deities; the higher the aspirations, the better
the gods. Hence the ugly fetish of a savage tribe, and the
beautiful mythology of a Greek Civilisation. Change the
needs and aspirations of the Americans, therefore, and you
will have changed their worship, their national Deity, and
even their Government. And believe me, this change is
coming; people get tired of their gods as of everything else.
Ay, the time will come, when man in this America shall not
suffer for not being a seeker and lover and defender of the
Dollar....</p>
<p>&#8220;Obedience, like faith, is a divine gift; but only when it
comes from the heart: only when prompted by love and sincerity
is it divine. If you can not, however, reverence what
you obey, then, I say, withhold your obedience. And if you
prefer to barter your identity or ego for a counterfeit coin
of ideology, that right is yours. For under a liberal Constitution
and in a free Government, you are also at liberty
to sell your soul, to open a bank account for your conscience.
But don&#8217;t blame God, or Destiny, or Society, when you find
yourself, after doing this, a brother to the ox. Herein, we
Orientals differ from Europeans and Americans; we are
never bribed into obedience. We obey either from reverence
and love, or from fear. We are either power-worshippers
or cowards but never, never traders. It might be said
that the masses in the East are blind slaves, while in Europe
and America they are become blind rebels. And which is
the better part of valour, when one is blind&ndash;&ndash;submission or
revolt?...</p>
<p>&#8220;No; popular suffrage helps not the suffering individual;
nor does it conduce to a better and higher morality. Why,
my Masters, it can not as much as purge its own channels.
For what is the ballot box, I ask again, but a modern vehicle
of corruption and debasement? The ballot box, believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
me, can not add a cubit to your frame, nor can it shed
a modicum of light on the deeper problems of life. Of
course, it is the exponent of the will of the majority, that is
to say, the will of the Party that has more money at its disposal.
The majority, and Iblis, and Juhannam&ndash;&ndash;ah, come
out with me to the new gods!...&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we must make allowance for these girds and
gibes at Democracy, of which we have given a specimen.
Khalid&#8217;s irony bites so deep at times as to get
at the very bone of truth. And here is the marrow
of it. We translate the following prophecy with
which he closes his Chapter &#8220;In Prison,&#8221; and with it,
too, we close ours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;But my faith in man,&#8221; he swears, &#8220;is as strong as my
faith in God. And as strong, too, perhaps, is my faith in
the future world-ruling destiny of America. To these United
States shall the Nations of the World turn one day for the
best model of good Government; in these United States the
well-springs of the higher aspirations of the soul shall quench
the thirst of every race-traveller on the highway of emancipation;
and from these United States the sun and moon of
a great Faith and a great Art shall rise upon mankind. I
believe this, billah! and I am willing to go on the witness
stand to swear to it. Ay, in this New World, the higher
Superman shall rise. And he shall not be of the tribe of
Overmen of the present age, of the beautiful blond beast of
Zarathustra, who would riddle mankind as they would riddle
wheat or flour; nor of those political moralists who would
reform the world as they would a parish.</p>
<p>&#8220;From his transcendental height, the Superman of America
shall ray forth in every direction the divine light, which
shall mellow and purify the spirit of Nations and strengthen
and sweeten the spirit of men, in this New World, I tell
you, he shall be born, but he shall not be an American in
the Democratic sense. He shall be nor of the Old World
nor of the New; he shall be, my Brothers, of both. In him
shall be reincarnated the Asiatic spirit of origination, of
Poesy and Prophecy, and the European spirit of Art, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
American spirit of Invention. Ay, the Nation that leads
the world to-day in material progress shall lead it, too, in
the future, in the higher things of the mind and soul. And
when you reach that height, O beloved America, you will
be far from the majority-rule, and Iblis, and Juhannam.
And you will then conquer those &#8216;enormous mud Megatheriums&#8217;
of which Carlyle makes loud mention.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SUBTRANSCENDENTAL</h3>
</div>
<p>Deficiencies in individuals, as in States, have
their value and import. Indeed, that sublime
impulse of perfectibility, always vivacious, always
working under various forms and with one underlying
purpose, would be futile without them, and fatuous.
And what were life without this incessant striving of
the spirit? What were life without its angles of difficulty
and defeat, and its apices of triumph and
power? A banality this, you will say. But need
we not be reminded of these wholesome truths, when
the striving after originality nowadays is productive of
so much quackery? The impulse of perfectibility, we
repeat, whether at work in a Studio, or in a Factory,
or in a Prison Cell, is the most noble of all human impulses,
the most divine.</p>
<p>Of that Chapter, In Prison, we have given
what might be called the exogenous bark of the Soul,
or that which environment creates. And now we
shall endeavour to show the reader somewhat of the
ludigenous process, by which the Soul, thrumming its
own strings or eating its own guts, develops and increases
its numbers. For Khalid in these gaol-days is
much like Hamlet&#8217;s player, or even like Hamlet himself&ndash;&ndash;always
soliloquising, tearing a passion to rags.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
And what mean these outbursts and objurgations of
his, you will ask; these suggestions, fugitive, rhapsodical,
mystical; this furibund allegro about Money,
Mediums, and Bohemia; these sobs and tears and
asseverations, in which our Lady of the Studio and
Shakib are both expunged with great billahs;&ndash;&ndash;the
force and significance of these subliminal uprushes,
dear Reader, we confess we are, like yourself, unable
to understand, without the aid of our Interpreter.
We shall, therefore, let him speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;When in prison,&#8221; writes Shakib, &#8220;Khalid was
subject to spasms and strange hallucinations. One
day, when I was sweating in the effort to get him out
of gaol, he sends me word to come and see him. I
go; and after waiting a while at the Iron gate, I behold
Khalid rushing down the isle like an angry lion.
&#8216;What do you want,&#8217; he growled, &#8216;why are you
here?&#8217; And I, amazed, &#8216;Did you not send for me?&#8217;
And he snapped up, &#8216;I did; but you should not have
come. You should withhold from me your favours.&#8217;
Life of Allah, I was stunned. I feared lest his mind,
too, had gone in the direction of his health, which
was already sorrily undermined. I looked at him
with dim, tearful eyes, and assured him that soon he
shall be free. &#8216;And what is the use of freedom,&#8217; he
exclaimed, &#8216;when it drags us to lower and darker
depths? Don&#8217;t think I am miserable in prison. No;
I am not&ndash;&ndash;I am happy. I have had strange visions,
marvellous. O my Brother, if you could behold the
sloughs, deeper and darker than any prison-cell, into
which <i>you</i> have thrown me. Yes, <i>you</i>&ndash;&ndash;and another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
O, I hate you both. I hate my best lovers. I hate
You&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;no, no, no.&#8217; And he falls on me, embraces
me, and bathes my cheeks with his tears. After
which he falters out beseechingly, &#8216;Promise, promise
that you will not give me any more money, and
though starving and in rags you find me crouching at
your door, promise.&#8217; And of a truth, I acquiesced in
all he said, seeing how shaken in body and mind he
was. But not until I had made a promise under oath
would he be tranquillised. And so, after our farewell
embrace, he asked me to come again the following day
and bring him some books to read. This I did, fetching
with me Rousseau&#8217;s <i>Emile</i> and Carlyle&#8217;s
<i>Hero-Worship</i>, the only two books he had in
the cellar. And when he saw them, he exclaimed
with joy, &#8216;The very books I want! I read them twice
already, and I shall read them again. O, let me
kiss you for the thought.&#8217; And in an ecstasy he
overwhelms me again with suffusing sobs and embraces.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a difference, I thought, between Khalid of
yesterday and Khalid of to-day. What a transformation!
Even I who know the turn and temper of his
nature had much this time to fear. Surely, an alienist
would have made a case of him. But I began to
get an inkling into his cue of passion, when he told
me that he was going to start a little business again,
if I lend him the necessary capital. But I reminded
him that we shall soon be returning home. &#8216;No, not
I,&#8217; he swore; &#8216;not until I can pay my own passage, at
least. I told you yesterday I&#8217;ll accept no more money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
from you, except, of course, the sum I need to start
the little business I am contemplating.&#8217; &#8216;And suppose
you lose this money,&#8217; I asked.&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Why, then <i>you</i>
lose <i>me</i>. But no, you shall not. For I know, I believe,
I am sure, I swear that my scheme this time will
not be a failure in any sense of the word. I have
heavenly testimony on that.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;And what was the
matter with you yesterday? Why were you so queer?&#8217;
&#8216;O, I had nightmares and visions the night before, and
you came too early in the morning. See this.&#8217; And
he holds down his head to show me the back of his
neck. &#8216;Is there no swelling here? I feel it. Oh, it
pains me yet. But I shall tell you about it and about
the vision when I am out.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;And at this, the gaoler
comes to inform us that Khalid&#8217;s minutes are spent
and he must return to his cell.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of which from our Interpreter is as clear as God
Save the King. And from which we hope our Reader
will infer that those outbursts and tears and rhapsodies
of Khalid did mean somewhat. They did mean,
even when we first approached his cell, that something
was going on in him&ndash;&ndash;a revolution, a <i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i>, so
to speak, of the spirit. For a Prince in Rags, but not
in Debts and Dishonour, will throttle the Harpy which
has hitherto ruled and degraded his soul.</p>
<p>But the dwelling, too, of that soul is sorely undermined.
And so, his leal and loving friend Shakib
takes him later to the best physician in the City, who
after the tapping and auscultation, shakes his
head, writes his prescriptions, and advises Khalid to
keep in the open air as much as possible, or better still,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
to return to his native country. The last portion of
the advice, however, Khalid can not follow at present.
For he will either return home on his own account
or die in New York. &#8220;If I can not in time save
enough money for the Steamship Company,&#8221; he said
to Shakib, &#8220;I can at least leave enough to settle the
undertaker&#8217;s bill. And in either case, I shall have
paid my own passage out of this New World. And I
shall stand before my Maker in a shroud, at least,
which I can call my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which Shakib replies by going to the druggist
with the prescriptions. And when he returns to the
cellar with a package of four or five medicine bottles
for rubbing and smelling and drinking, he finds Khalid
sitting near the stove&ndash;&ndash;we are now in the last month
of Winter&ndash;&ndash;warming his hands on the flames of the
two last books he read. <i>Emile</i> and <i>Hero-Worship</i> go
the way of all the rest. And there he sits, meditating
over Carlyle&#8217;s crepitating fire and Rousseau&#8217;s writhing,
sibilating flame. And it may be he thought of neither.
Perhaps he was brooding over the resolution he had
made, and the ominous shaking of the doctor&#8217;s head.
Ah, but his tutelar deities are better physicians, he
thought. And having made his choice, he will pitch
the medicine bottles into the street, and only follow
the doctor&#8217;s advice by keeping in the open air.</p>
<p>Behold him, therefore, with a note in hand, applying
to Shakib, in a formal and business-like manner, for
a loan; and see that noble benefactor and friend, after
gladly giving the money, throw the note into the fire.
And now, Khalid is neither dervish nor philosopher,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
but a man of business with a capital of twenty-five
dollars in his pocket. And with one-fifth of this capital
he buys a second-hand push-cart from his Greek
neighbour, wends his way with it to the market-place,
makes a purchase there of a few boxes of oranges, sorts
them in his cart into three classes,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;there is no equality
in nature,&#8221; he says, while doing this,&ndash;&ndash;sticks a price
card at the head of each class, and starts, in the name
of Allah, his business. That is how he will keep in the
open air twelve hours a day.</p>
<p>But in the district where he is known he does not
long remain. The sympathy of his compatriots is to
him worse than the doctor&#8217;s medicines, and those who
had often heard him speechifying exchanged significant
looks when he passed. Moreover, the police would
not let him set up his stand anywhere. &#8220;There comes
the push-cart orator,&#8221; they would say to each other;
and before our poor Syrian stops to breathe, one of
them grumpishly cries out, &#8220;Move on there! Move
on!&#8221; Once Khalid ventures to ask, &#8220;But why are
others allowed to set up their stands here?&#8221; And
the &#8220;copper&#8221; (we beg the Critic&#8217;s pardon again)
coming forward twirling his club, lays his hand on
Khalid&#8217;s shoulder and calmly this: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
I know you? Move on, I say.&#8221; O Khalid, have you
forgotten that these &#8220;coppers&#8221; are the minions of
Tammany? Why tarry, therefore, and ask questions?
Yes, make a big move at once&ndash;&ndash;out of the district
entirely.</p>
<p>Now, to the East Side, into the Jewish Quarter,
Khalid directs his cart. And there, he falls in with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Jewish fellow push-cart peddlers and puts up with
them in a cellar similar to his in the Syrian Quarter.
But only for a month could he suffer what the Jew
has suffered for centuries. Why? There is this difference
between the cellar of the Semite Syrian and
that of the Semite Jew: in the first we eat <i>mojadderah</i>,
in the second, <i>kosher</i> but stinking flesh; in the
first we read poetry and play the lute, in the
second we fight about the rent and the division of the
profits of the day; in the first we sleep in linen &#8220;as
white as the wings of the dove,&#8221; in the second on pieces
of smelly blankets; the first is redolent of ottar of
roses, Shakib&#8217;s favourite perfume, the second is especially
made insufferable by that stench which is
peculiar to every Hebrew hive. For these and other
reasons, Khalid separates himself from his Semite fellow
peddlers, and makes this time a bigger move than
the first.</p>
<p>Ay, even to the Bronx, where often in former days,
shouldering the peddling-box, he tramped, will he now
push his orange-cart and his hopes. There, between
City and Country, nearer to Nature, and not far from
the traffic of life, he fares better both in health and
purse. It is much to his liking, this upper end of the
City. Here the atmosphere is more peaceful and
soothing, and the police are more agreeable. No, they
do not nickname and bully him in the Bronx. And
never was he ordered to move on, even though he set
up his stand for months at the same corner. &#8220;Ah,
how much kinder and more humane people become,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;even when they are not altogether out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
City, but only on the outskirts of the country expanse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khalid passes the Spring and Summer in the Bronx
and keeps in the open air, not only in the day, but
also in the night. How he does this, is told in a letter
which he writes to Shakib. But does he sleep at all,
you ask, and how, and where? Reader, we thank
you for your anxiety about Khalid&#8217;s health. And we
would fain show you the Magic Carpet which he carries
in the lock-box of his push-cart. But see for yourself,
here be neither Magic Carpet, nor Magic Ring.
Only his papers, a few towels, a blanket, some underwear,
and his coffee utensils, are here. For Khalid
could forego his <i>mojadderah</i>, but never his coffee, the
Arab that he is. But an Arab on the wayfare, if he
finds himself at night far from the camp, will dig him
a ditch in the sands and lie there to sleep under the
living stars. Khalid could not do thus, neither in the
City nor out of it. And yet, he did not lodge within
doors. He hired a place only for his push-cart; and
this, a small padlock-booth where he deposits his stock
in trade. But how he lived in the Bronx is described
in the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;My loving Brother Shakib,</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been two months here, in a neighbourhood familiar
to you. Not far from the place where I sleep is the sycamore
tree under which I burned my peddling-box. And perhaps I
shall yet burn there my push-cart too. But for the present,
all&#8217;s well. My business is good and my health is improving.
The money-order I am enclosing with this, will cancel the
note, but not the many debts, I owe you. And I hope to be
able to join you again soon, to make the voyage to our native
land together. Meanwhile I am working, and laying up a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
little something. I make from two to three dollars a day, of
which I never spend more than one. And this on one meal
only; for my lodging and my lunch and breakfast cost next
to nothing. Yes, I can be a push-cart peddler in the day; I
can sleep out of doors at night; I can do with coffee and
oranges for lunch and breakfast; but in the evening I will
assert my dignity and do justice to my taste: I will dine at
the Hermitage and permit you to call me a fool. And why
not, since my purse, like my stomach, is now my own? Why
not go to the Hermitage since my push-cart income permits
of it? But the first night I went there my shabbiness attracted
the discomforting attention of the fashionable diners,
and made even the waiters offensive. Indeed, one of them
came to ask if I were looking for somebody. &#8216;No,&#8217; I replied
with suppressed indignation; &#8216;I&#8217;m looking for a place where
I can sit down and eat, without being eaten by the eyes of
the vulgar curious.&#8217; And I pass into an arbor, which from
that night becomes virtually my own, followed by a waiter
who from that night, too, became my friend. For every
evening I go there, I find my table unoccupied and my waiter
ready to receive and serve me. But don&#8217;t think he does this
for the sake of my black eyes or my philosophy. That disdainful
glance of his on the first evening I could never forget,
billah. And I found that it could be baited and mellowed
only by a liberal tip. And this I make in advance
every week for both my comfort and his. Yes, I am a fool,
I grant you, but I&#8217;m not out of my element there.</p>
<p>&#8220;After dinner I take a stroll in the Flower Gardens, and
crossing the rickety wooden bridge over the river, I enter the
hemlock grove. Here, in a sequestered spot near the river
bank, I lay me on the grass and sleep for the night. I always
bring my towels with me; for in the morning I take
a dip, and at night I use them for a pillow. When the
weather requires it, I bring my blankets too. And hanging
one of them over me, tied to the trees by the cords sown to
its corners, I wrap myself in the other, and praise Allah.</p>
<p>&#8220;These and the towels, after taking my bath, I leave at the
Hermitage; my waiter minds them for me. And so, I suspect
I am happy&ndash;&ndash;if, curse it! I could but breathe better.
O, come up to see me. I&#8217;ll give you a royal dinner at the
Hermitage, and a royal bed in the hemlock grove on the
river-bank. Do come up, the peace of Allah upon thee. Read
my salaam to Im-Hanna.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>And during his five months in the Bronx he did not
sleep five nights within doors, we are told, nor did he
once dine out of the Hermitage. Even his hair, a fantastic
fatuity behind a push-cart, he did not take the
trouble to cut or trim. It must have helped his business.
But this constancy, never before sustained to
such a degree, must soon cease, having laid up, thanks
to his push-cart and the people of the Bronx, enough
to carry him, not only to Baalbek, but to <i>Aymakanenkan</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE FALSE DAWN</h3>
</div>
<p>What the Arabs always said of Andalusia, Khalid
and Shakib said once of America: a most beautiful
country with one single vice&ndash;&ndash;it makes foreigners
forget their native land. But now they are both
suffering from nostalgia, and America, therefore, is
without a single vice. It is perfect, heavenly, ideal.
In it one sees only the vices of other races, and the
ugliness of other nations. America herself is as lovely
as a dimpled babe, and as innocent. A dimpled babe
she. But wait until she grows, and she will have
more than one vice to demand <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'forgetfuless'">forgetfulness</ins>.</p>
<p>Shakib, however, is not going to wait. He begins
to hear the call of his own country, now that his bank
account is big enough to procure for him the Pashalic
of Syria. And Khalid, though his push-cart had developed
to a stationary fruit stand,&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps for
this very reason,&ndash;&ndash;is now desirous of leaving America
anon. He is afraid of success overtaking him.
Moreover, the Bronx Park has awakened in him his
long dormant love of Nature. For while warming
himself on the flames of knowledge in the cellar, or
rioting with the Bassarides of Bohemia, or canvassing
and speechifying for Tammany, he little thought of
what he had deserted in his native country. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
ancient historical rivers flowing through a land made
sacred by the divine madness of the human spirit; the
snow-capped mountains at the feet of which the lily
and the oleander bloom; the pine forests diffusing
their fragrance even among the downy clouds; the
peaceful, sun-swept multi-coloured meadows; the trellised
vines, the fig groves, the quince orchards, the
orangeries: the absence of these did not disturb his
serenity in the cellar, his voluptuousness in Bohemia,
his enthusiasm in Tammany Land.</p>
<p>And we must not forget to mention that, besides the
divine voice of Nature and native soil, he long since
has heard and still hears the still sweet voice of one
who might be dearer to him than all. For Khalid,
after his return from Bohemia, continued to curse the
huris in his dreams. And he little did taste of the
blessings of &#8220;sore labour&#8217;s bath, balm of hurt minds.&#8221;
Ay, when he was not racked and harrowed by
nightmares, he was either disturbed by the angels
of his visions or the succubi of his dreams. And so, he
determines to go to Syria for a night&#8217;s sleep, at least,
of the innocent and just. His cousin Najma is there,
and that is enough. Once he sees her, the huris are
no more.</p>
<p>Now Shakib, who is more faithful in his narration
than we first thought&ndash;&ndash;who speaks of Khalid as he
is, extenuating nothing&ndash;&ndash;gives us access to a letter
which he received from the Bronx a month before their
departure from New York. In these Letters of
Khalid, which our Scribe happily preserved, we feel
somewhat relieved of the dogmatism, fantastic, mystical,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
severe, which we often meet with in the K. L. MS.
In his Letters, our Syrian peddler and seer is a plain
blunt man unbosoming himself to his friend. Read
this, for instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;My loving Brother:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is raining so hard to-night that I must sleep, or in fact
keep, within doors. Would you believe it, I am no more accustomed
to the luxuries of a soft spring-bed, and I can not
even sleep on the floor, where I have moved my mattress. I
am sore, broken in mind and spirit. Even the hemlock grove
and the melancholy stillness of the river, are beginning to annoy
me. Oh, I am tired of everything here, tired even of
the cocktails, tired of the push-cart, tired of earning as much
as five dollars a day. Next Sunday is inauguration day for
my stationary fruit stand; but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to
stand there long enough to deserve to be baptized with champagne.
If you come up, therefore, we&#8217;ll have a couple of
steins at the Hermitage and call it square.&ndash;&ndash;O, I would
square myself with the doctors by thrusting a poker down my
windpipe: I might be able to breathe better then. I pause
to curse my fate.&ndash;&ndash;Curse it, Juhannam-born, curse it!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not sleep, nor on the spring-bed, nor on the floor.
It is two hours past midnight now, and I shall try to while
away the time by scrawling this to you. My brother, I can
not long support this sort of life, being no more fit for
rough, ignominious labor. &#8216;But why,&#8217; you will ask, &#8216;did
you undertake it?&#8217; Yes, why? Strictly speaking, I made a
mistake. But it&#8217;s a noble mistake, believe me&ndash;&ndash;a mistake
which everybody in my condition ought to make, if but once
in their life-time. Is it not something to be able to make an
honest resolution and carry it out? I have heard strange
voices in prison; I have hearkened to them; but I find that
one must have sound lungs, at least, to be able to do the will
of the immortal gods. And even if he had, I doubt if he
could do much to suit them in America. O, my greatest
enemy and benefactor in the whole world is this dumb-hearted
mother, this America, in whose iron loins I have been
spiritually conceived. Paradoxical, this? But is it not true?
Was not the Khalid, now writing to you, born in the cellar?
Down there, in the very loins of New York? But alas, our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
spiritual Mother devours, like a cat, her own children. How
then can we live with her in the same house?</p>
<p>&#8220;I need not tell you now that the ignominious task I set my
hands to, was never to my liking. But the ox under the yoke
is not asked whether he likes it or not. I have been yoked to
my push-cart by the immortal gods; and soon my turn and
trial will end. It must end. For our country is just beginning
to speak, and I am her chosen voice. I feel that if I
do not respond, if I do not come to her, she will be dumb
forever. No; I can not remain here any more. For I can
not be strenuous enough to be miserably happy; nor stupid
enough to be contentedly miserable. I confess I have been
spoiled by those who call themselves spiritual sisters of mine.
The huris be dam&#8217;d. And if I don&#8217;t leave this country soon,
I&#8217;ll find myself sharing the damnation again&ndash;&ndash;in Bohemia.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The power of the soul is doubled by the object of its
love, or by such labor of love as it undertakes. But, here I
am, with no work and nobody I can love; nay, chained to a
task which I now abominate. If a labor of love doubles the
power of the soul, a labor of hate, to use an antonym term,
warps it, poisons it, destroys it. Is it not a shame that in
this great Country,&ndash;&ndash;this Circe with her golden horns of
plenty,&ndash;&ndash;one can not as much as keep his blood in circulation
without damning the currents of one&#8217;s soul? O America,
equally hated and beloved of Khalid, O Mother of prosperity
and spiritual misery, the time will come when you
shall see that your gold is but pinchbeck, your gilt-edge
bonds but death decrees, and your god of wealth a carcase
enthroned upon a dung-hill. But you can not see this now;
for you are yet in the false dawn, floundering tumultuously,
worshipping your mammoth carcase on a dung-hill&ndash;&ndash;and
devouring your spiritual children. Yes, America is now in
the false dawn, and as sure as America lives, the true dawn
must follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon, Shakib. I did not mean to end my letter in a
rhapsody. But I am so wrought, so broken in body, so inflamed
in spirit. I hope to see you soon. No, I hope to see
myself with you on board of a Transatlantic steamer.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And is not Khalid, like his spiritual Mother, floundering,
too, in the false dawn of life? His love of Nature,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
which was spontaneous and free, is it not likely
to become formal and scientific? His love of Country,
which begins tremulously, fervently in the woods
and streams, is it not likely to end in Nephelococcygia?
His determination to work, which was rudely shaken
at a push-cart, is it not become again a determination
to loaf? And now, that he has a little money laid up,
has he not the right to seek in this world the cheapest
and most suitable place for loafing? And where, if
not in the Lebanon hills, &#8220;in which it seemed always
afternoon,&#8221; can he rejoin the Lotus-Eaters of the
East? This man of visions, this fantastic, rhapsodical&ndash;&ndash;but
we must not be hard upon him. Remember,
good Reader, the poker which he would thrust
down his windpipe to broaden it a little. With
asthmatic fits and tuberous infiltrations, one is permitted
to commune with any of Allah&#8217;s ministers of
grace or spirits of Juhannam. And that divine spark
of primal, paradisical love, which is rapidly devouring
all others&ndash;&ndash;let us not forget that. Ay, we mean his
cousin Najma. Of course, he speaks, too, of his nation,
his people, awaking, lisping, beginning to speak,
waiting for him, the chosen Voice! Which reminds
us of how he was described to us by the hasheesh-smokers
of Cairo.</p>
<p>In any event, the Reader will rejoice with us, we
hope, that Khalid will not turn again toward Bohemia.
He will agree with us that, whether on account of his
health, or his love, or his mission, it is well, in his
present fare of mind and body, that he is returning
to the land &#8220;in which it seemed always afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE LAST STAR</h3>
</div>
<p>Is it not an ethnic phenomenon that a descendant
of the ancient Ph&oelig;nicians can not understand
the meaning and purport of the Cash Register in
America? Is it not strange that this son of Superstition
and Trade can not find solace in the fact that in
this Pix of Business is the Host of the Demiurgic Dollar?
Indeed, the omnipresence and omnipotence of it
are not without divine significance. For can you not
see that this Cash Register, this Pix of Trade, is
prominently set up on the altar of every institution,
political, moral, social, and religious? Do you not
meet with it everywhere, and foremost in the sanctuaries
of the mind and the soul? In the Societies for
the Diffusion of Knowledge; in the Social Reform
Propagandas; in the Don&#8217;t Worry Circles of Metaphysical
Gymnasiums; in Alliances, Philanthropic,
Educational; in the Board of Foreign Missions; in the
Sacrarium of Vaticinatress Eddy; in the Church of
God itself;&ndash;&ndash;is not the Cash Register a divine symbol
of the <i>credo</i>, the faith, or the idea?</p>
<p>&#8220;To trade, or not to trade,&#8221; Hamlet-Khalid exclaims,
&#8220;that is the question: whether &#8217;tis nobler in
the mind to suffer, etc., or to take arms against the
Cash Registers of America, and by opposing end&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
What? Sacrilegious wretch, would you set your face
against the divinity in the Holy Pix of Trade? And
what will you end, and how will You end by it?
An eternal problem, this, of opposing and ending.
But before you set your face in earnest, we would ask
you to consider if the vacancy or chaos which is sure
to follow, be not more pernicious than what you would
end. If you are sure it is not, go ahead, and we give
you Godspeed. If you have the least doubt about it&ndash;&ndash;but
Khalid is incapable now of doubting anything.
And whether he opposes his theory of immanent morality
to the Cash Register, or to Democracy, or to
the ruling powers of Flunkeydom, we hope He will
end well. Such is the penalty of revolt against the
dominating spirit of one&#8217;s people and ancestors, that
only once in a generation is it attempted, and scarcely
with much success. In fact, the first who revolts must
perish, the second, too, and the third, and the fourth,
until, in the course of time and by dint of repetition
and resistance, the new species of the race can overcome
the forces of environment and the crushing influence
of conformity. This, we know, is the biological
law, and Khalid must suffer under it. For, as
far as our knowledge extends, he is the first Syrian,
the ancient Lebanon monks excepted, who revolted
against the ruling spirit of his people and the dominant
tendencies of the times, both in his native and his
adopted Countries.</p>
<p>Yes, the <i>&ecirc;thos</i> of the Syrians (for once we use Khalid&#8217;s
philosophic term), like that of the Americans,
is essentially money-seeking. And whether in Beirut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
or in New York, even the moralists and reformers,
like the hammals and grocers, will ask themselves, before
they undertake to do anything for you or for their
country, &#8220;What will this profit us? How much will
it bring us?&#8221; And that is what Khalid once thought
to oppose and end. Alas, oppose he might&ndash;&ndash;and
End He Must. How can an individual, without
the aid of Time and the Unseen Powers, hope to oppose
and end, or even change, this monstrous mass of
things? Yet we must not fail to observe that when
we revolt against a tendency inimical to our law of
being, it is for our own sake, and not the race&#8217;s, that
we do so. And we are glad we are able to infer, if
not from the K. L, MS., at least from his Letters,
that Khalid is beginning to realise this truth. Let us
not, therefore, expatiate further upon it.</p>
<p>If the reader will accompany us now to the cellar
to bid our Syrian friends farewell, we promise a few
things of interest. When we first came here some few
years ago in Winter, or to another such underground
dwelling, the water rose ankle-deep over the floor, and
the mould and stench were enough to knock an ox
dead. Now, a scent of ottar of roses welcomes us at
the door and leads us to a platform in the centre,
furnished with a Turkish rug, which Shakib will present
to the landlord as a farewell memento.</p>
<p>And here are our three Syrians making ready for the
voyage. Shakib is intoning some verses of his while
packing; Im-Hanna is cooking the last dish of
<i>mojadderah</i>; and Khalid, with some vague dream in
his eyes, and a vaguer, far-looming hope in his heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
is sitting on his trunk wondering at the variety of
things Shakib is cramming into his. For our Scribe,
we must not fail to remind the Reader, is contemplating
great things of State, is nourishing a great political
ambition. He will, therefore, bethink him of those in
power at home. Hence these costly presents. Ay, besides
the plated jewellery&ndash;&ndash;the rings, bracelets,
brooches, necklaces, ear-rings, watches, and chains&ndash;&ndash;of
which he is bringing enough to supply the peasants
of three villages, see that beautiful gold-knobbed ebony
stick, which he will present to the vali, and this
precious gold cross with a ruby at the heart for the
Patriarch, and these gold fountain pens for his literary
friends, and that fine Winchester rifle for the chief of
the tribe Anezah. These he packs in the bottom of
his trunk, and with them his precious dilapidated copy
of Al-Mutanabbi, and&ndash;&ndash;what MS. be this? What,
a Book of Verse spawned in the cellar? Indeed, the
very embryo of that printed copy we read in Cairo,
and which Shakib and his friends would have us translate
for the benefit of the English reading public.</p>
<p>For our Scribe is the choragus of the Modern
School of Arabic poetry. And this particular Diwan
of his is a sort of rhymed inventory of all the inventions
and discoveries of modern Science and all the
wonders of America. He has published other Diwans,
in which French morbidity is crowned with laurels
from the Arabian Nights. For this Modern School
has two opposing wings, moved by two opposing
forces, Science being the motive power of the one, and
Byron and De Musset the inspiring geniuses of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
other. We would not be faithful to our Editorial
task and to our Friend, if we did not give here a few
luminant examples of the Diwan in question. We
are, indeed, very sorry, for the sake of our readers, that
space will not allow us to give them a few whole
qas&iuml;dahs from it. To those who are so fortunate as
to be able to read and understand the Original, we
point out the Ode to the Phonograph, beginning thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>O Phonograph, thou wonder of our time,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Thy tongue of wax can sing like me in rhyme.&#8221;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>And another to the Brooklyn Bridge, of which
these are the opening lines:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>O Brooklyn Bridge, how oft upon thy back<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>I tramped, and once I crossed thee in a hack.&#8221;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>And finally, the great Poem entitled, On the Virtue
and Benefit of Modern Science, of which we remember
these couplets:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>Balloons and airships, falling from the skies,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Will be as plenty yet as summer flies.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span><br />
<span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>Electricity and Steam and Compressed Air<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Will carry us to heaven yet, I swear.&#8221;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>Here be rhymed truth, at least, which can boast of
not being poetry. Ay, in this MS. which Shakib is
packing along with Al-Mutanabbi in the bottom of his
trunk to evade the Basilisk touch of the Port officials of
Beirut, is packed all the hopes of the Modern School.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
Pack on, Shakib; for whether at the Mena House, or
in the hasheesh-dens of Cairo, the Future is drinking
to thee, and dreaming of thee and thy School its opium
dreams. And Khalid, the while, sits impassive on his
trunk, and Im-Hanna is cooking the last dinner of
<i>mojadderah</i>.</p>
<p>Emigration has introduced into Syria somewhat of
the three prominent features of Civilisation: namely, a
little wealth, a few modern ideas, and many strange
diseases. And of these three blessings our two Syrians
together are plentifully endowed. For Shakib is a
type of the emigrant, who returns home prosperous in
every sense of the word. A Book of Verse to lure
Fame, a Letter of Credit to bribe her if necessary, and
a double chin to praise the gods. This is a complete
set of the prosperity, which Khalid knows not. But
he has in his lungs what Shakib the poet can not boast
of; while in his trunk he carries but a little wearing
apparel, his papers, and his blankets. And in his
pocket, he has his ribbed silver cigarette case&ndash;&ndash;the
only object he can not part with&ndash;&ndash;a heart-shaped
locket with a little diamond star on its face&ndash;&ndash;the
only present he is bringing with him home,&ndash;&ndash;and a
third-class passage across the Atlantic. For Khalid
will not sleep in a bunk, even though it be furnished
with eiderdown cushions and tiger skins.</p>
<p>And since he is determined to pass his nights on
deck, it matters little whether he travels first class, or
second or tenth. Shakib, do what he may, cannot prevail
upon him to accept the first-class passage he had
bought in his name. &#8220;Let us not quarrel about this,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
says he; &#8220;we shall be together on board the same ship,
and that settles the question. Indeed, the worse way
returning home must be ultimately the best. No,
Shakib, it matters not how I travel, if I but get away
quickly from this pandemonium of Civilisation.
Even now, as I sit on this trunk waiting for the hour
of departure, I have a foretaste of the joy of being
away from the insidious cries of hawkers, the tormenting
bells of the rag-man, the incessant howling of children,
the rumbling of carts and wagons, the malicious
whir of cable cars, the grum shrieks of ferry boats, and
the thundering, reverberating, smoking, choking, blinding
abomination of an elevated railway. A musician
might extract some harmony from this chaos of noises,
this jumble of sounds. But I&ndash;&ndash;extract me quickly
from them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ay, quickly please, especially for our sake and the
Reader&#8217;s. Now, the dinner is finished, the rug is
folded and presented to our landlord with our salaams,
the trunks are locked and roped, and our Arabs will
silently steal away. And peacefully, too, were it not
that an hour before sailing a capped messenger is come
to deliver a message to Shakib. There is a pleasant
dilative sensation in receiving a message on board a
steamer, especially when the messenger has to seek you
among the Salon passengers. Now, Shakib dilates with
pride as he takes the envelope in his hand; but when
he opens it, and reads on the enclosed card, &#8220;Mr.
Isaac Goldheimer wishes you a <i>bon voyage</i>,&#8221; he turns
quickly on his heels and goes on deck to walk his wrath
away. For this Mr. Goldheimer is the very landlord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
who received the Turkish rug. Reflect on this,
Reader. Father Abraham would have walked with us
to the frontier to betoken his thanks and gratitude.
&#8220;But this modern Jew and his miserable card,&#8221; exclaims
Shakib in his teeth, as he tears and throws it in
the water,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;who asked him to send it, and who
would have sued him if he didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Shakib, who has lived so long in America and
traded with its people, is yet ignorant of some of the
fine forms and conventions of Civilisation. He
does not know that fashionable folk, or those aping
the dear fashionable folk, have a right to assert their
superiority at his expense.&ndash;&ndash;I do not care to see you,
but I will send a messenger and card to do so for me.
You are not my equal, and I will let you know this,
even at the hour of your departure, and though I have
to hire a messenger to do so.&ndash;&ndash;Is there no taste, no
feeling, no gratitude in this? Don&#8217;t you wish, O
Shakib,&ndash;&ndash;but compose yourself. And think not so ill
of your Jewish landlord, whom you wish you could
wrap in that rug and throw overboard. He certainly
meant well. That formula of card and messenger is
so convenient and so cheap. Withal, is he not too
busy, think you, to come up to the dock for the puerile,
prosaic purpose of shaking hands and saying ta-ta?
If you can not consider the matter in this light, try to
forget it. One must not be too visceral at the hour of
departure. Behold, your skyscrapers and your Statue
of Liberty are now receding from view; and your
landlord and his card and messenger will be further
from us every while we think of them, until, thanks to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Time and Space and Steam! they will be too far away
to be remembered.</p>
<p>Here, then, with our young Seer and our Scribe,
we bid New York farewell, and earnestly hope that
we do not have to return to it again, or permit any
of them to do so. In fact, we shall not hereafter consider,
with any ulterior material or spiritual motive,
any more of such disparaging, denigrating matter, in
the two MSS. before us, as has to pass through our reluctant
hands &#8220;touchin&#8217; on and appertainin&#8217; to&#8221; the
great City of Manhattan and its distinguished
denizens. For our part, we have had enough of this
painful task. And truly, we have never before undergone
such trials in sailing between&ndash;&ndash;but that
Charybdis and Scylla allusion has been done to death.
Indeed, we love America, and in the course of our
present task, which we also love, we had to suffer
Khalid&#8217;s shafts to pass through our ken and sometimes
really through our heart. But no more of this. Ay,
we would fain set aside our pen from sheer weariness
of spirit and bid the Reader, too, farewell. Truly, we
would end here this Book of Khalid were it not that
the greater part of the most important material in the
K. L. MS. is yet intact, and the more interesting portion
of Shakib&#8217;s History is yet to come. Our readers,
though we do not think they are sorry for having come
out with us so far, are at liberty either to continue
with us, or say good-bye. But for the Editor there is
no choice. What we have begun we must end, unmindful
of the influence, good or ill, of the Zodiacal
Signs under which we work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our Ph&oelig;nician ancestors,&#8221; says Khalid, &#8220;never
left anything they undertook unfinished. Consider
what they accomplished in their days, and the degree
of culture they attained. The most beautiful fabrications
in metals and precious stones were prepared in
Syria. Here, too, the most important discoveries were
made: namely, those of glass and purple. As for me,
I can not understand what the Murex trunculus is;
and I am not certain if scholars and arch&aelig;ologists, or
even mariners and fishermen, will ever find a fossil
of that particular species. But murex or no murex,
Purple was discovered by my ancestors. Hence the
purple passion, that is to say the energy and intensity
which coloured everything they did, everything they
felt and believed. For whether in bemoaning Tammuz,
or in making tear-bottles, or in trading with the
Gauls and Britons, the Ph&oelig;nicians were the same
superstitious, honest, passionate, energetic people.
And do not forget, you who are now enjoying the
privilege of setting down your thoughts in words, that
on these shores of Syria written language received its
first development.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also said that they discovered and first navigated
the Atlantic Ocean, my Ph&oelig;nicians; that they
worked gold mines in the distant isle of Thasos and
opened silver mines in the South and Southwest of
Spain. In Africa, we know, they founded the colonies
of Utica and Carthage. But we are told they went
farther than this. And according to some historians,
they rounded the Cape, they circumnavigated Africa.
And according to recent discoveries made by an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
American arch&aelig;ologist, they must have discovered
America too! For in the ruins of the Aztecs of
Mexico there are traces of a Ph&oelig;nician language and
religion. This, about the discovery of America, however,
I can not verify with anything from Sanchuniathon.
But might they not have made this discovery
after the said Sanchuniathon had given up the ghost?
And if they did, what can We, their worthless descendants
do for them now? Ah, if we but knew the
name of their Columbus! No, it is not practical to
build a monument to a whole race of people. And
yet, they deserve more than this from us, their descendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;These dealers in tin and amber, these manufacturers
of glass and purple, these developers of a written
language, first gave the impetus to man&#8217;s activity and
courage and intelligence. And this activity of the industry
and will is not dead in man. It may be dead
in us Syrians, but not in the Americans. In their
strenuous spirit it rises uppermost. After all, I must
love the Americans, for they are my Ph&oelig;nician ancestors
incarnate. Ay, there is in the nature of things a
mysterious recurrence which makes for a continuous,
everlasting modernity. And I believe that the spirit
which moved those brave sea-daring navigators of yore,
is still working lustily, bravely, but alas, not joyously&ndash;&ndash;bitterly,
rather, selfishly, greedily&ndash;&ndash;behind the
steam engine, the electric motor, the plough, and in the
clinic and the studio as in the Stock Exchange. That
spirit in its real essence, however, is as young, as puissant
to-day as it was when the native of Byblus first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
struck out to explore the seas, to circumnavigate
Africa, to discover even America!&#8221;</p>
<p>And what in the end might Khalid discover for us
or for himself, at least, in his explorations of the
Spirit-World? What Colony of the chosen sons of
the young and puissant Spirit, on some distant isle beyond
the seven seas, might he found? To what far,
silent, undulating shore, where &#8220;a written language is
the instrument only of the lofty expressions and aspirations
of the soul&#8221; might he not bring us? What
Cape of Truth in the great Sea of Mystery might we
not be able to circumnavigate, if only this were possible
of the language of man?</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with glass,&#8221; he exclaims, &#8220;not with tear-bottles,
not with purple, not with a written language,
am I now concerned, but rather with what those in
Purple and those who make this written language their
capital, can bring within our reach of the treasures
of the good, the true, and the beautiful. I would fain
find a land where the soul of man, and the heart of
man, and the mind of man, are as the glass of my ancestors&#8217;
tear-bottles in their enduring quality and
beauty. My ancestors&#8217; tear-bottles, and though buried
in the earth ten thousand years, lose not a grain of
their original purity and transparency, of their soft and
iridescent colouring. But where is the natural colour
and beauty of these human souls, buried in bunks under
hatches? Or of those moving in high-lacquered salons
above?...</p>
<p>&#8220;O my Brothers of the clean and unclean species,
of the scented and smelling kind, of the have and have-not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
classes, there is but one star in this vague dusky
sky above us, for you as for myself. And that star
is either the last in the eternal darkness, or the first
in the rising dawn. It is either the first or the last
star of night. And who shall say which it is? Not
the Church, surely, nor the State; not Science, nor
Sociology, nor Philosophy, nor Religion. But the human
will shall influence that star and make it yield
its secret and its fire. Each of you, O my Brothers,
can make it light his own hut, warm his own heart,
guide his own soul. Never before in the history of
man did it seem as necessary as it does now that each
individual should think for himself, will for himself,
and aspire incessantly for the realisation of his ideals
and dreams. Yes, we are to-day at a terrible and
glorious turning point, and it depends upon us whether
that one star in the vague and dusky sky of modern
life, shall be the harbinger of Jannat or Juhannam.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>PRIESTO-PARENTAL</h3>
</div>
<p>If we remember that the name of Khalid&#8217;s cousin
is Najma (Star), the significance to himself of
the sign spoken of in the last Chapter, is quite evident.
But what it means to others remains to be seen. His
one star, however, judging from his month&#8217;s experience
in Baalbek, is not promising of Jannat. For
many things, including parental tyranny and priestcraft
and Jesuitism, will here conspire against the
single blessedness of him, which is now seeking to
double itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where one has so many Fathers,&#8221; he writes,
&#8220;and all are pretending to be the guardians of his
spiritual and material well-being, one ought to renounce
them all at once. It was not with a purpose
to rejoin my folk that I first determined to return to
my native country. For, while I believe in the
Family, I hate Familism, which is the curse of the
human race. And I hate this spiritual Fatherhood
when it puts on the garb of a priest, the three-cornered
hat of a Jesuit, the hood of a monk, the gaberdine of a
rabbi, or the jubbah of a sheikh. The sacredness of
the Individual, not of the Family or the Church, do
I proclaim. For Familism, or the propensity to keep
under the same roof, as a social principle, out of fear,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
ignorance, cowardice, or dependence, is, I repeat, the
curse of the world. Your father is he who is friendly
and reverential to the higher being in you; your
brothers are those who can appreciate the height and
depth of your spirit, who hearken to you, and believe
in you, if you have any truth to announce to them.
Surely, one&#8217;s value is not in his skin that you should
touch him. Are there any two individuals more closely
related than mother and son? And yet, when
I Khalid embrace my mother, mingling my tears with
hers, I feel that my soul is as distant from her own
as is Baalbek from the Dog-star. And so I say, this
attempt to bind together under the principle of Familism
conflicting spirits, and be it in the name of love
or religion or anything else more or less sacred, is in
itself a very curse, and should straightway end. It
will end, as far as I am concerned. And thou my
Brother, whether thou be a son of the Morning or of
the Noontide or of the Dusk,&ndash;&ndash;whether thou be a
Japanese or a Syrian or a British man&ndash;&ndash;if thou art
likewise circumstanced, thou shouldst do the same, not
only for thine own sake, but for the sake of thy family
as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>No; Khalid did not find that wholesome plant of
domestic peace in his mother&#8217;s Nursery. He found
noxious weeds, rather, and brambles galore. And
they were planted there, not by his father or mother,
but by those who have a lien upon the souls of these
poor people. For the priest here is no peeled,
polished affair, but shaggy, scrubby, terrible, forbidding.
And with a word he can open yet, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
such as Khalid&#8217;s folk, the gate which Peter keeps or
the other on the opposite side of the Universe.
Khalid must beware, therefore, how he conducts himself
at home and abroad, and how, in his native town,
he delivers his mind on sacred things, and profane.
In New York, for instance, or in Turabu for that
matter, he could say in plain forthright speech what
he thought of Family, Church or State, and no one
would mind him. But where these Institutions are
the rottenest existing he will be minded too well, and
reminded, too, of the fate of those who preceded
him.</p>
<p>The case of Habib Ish-Shidiak at Kannubin is not
yet forgotten. And Habib, be it known, was only a
poor Protestant neophite who took pleasure in carrying
a small copy of the Bible in his hip pocket, and
was just learning to roll his eyes in the pulpit
and invoke the &#8220;laud.&#8221; But Khalid, everybody out-protesting,
is such an intractable pro<i>test</i>ant, with,
neither Bible in his pocket nor pulpit at his service.
And yet, with a flint on his tongue and a spark in
his eyes, he will make the neophite Habib smile beside
him. For the priesthood in Syria is not, as we have
said, a peeled, polished, pulpy affair. And Khalid&#8217;s
father has been long enough in their employ to learn
somewhat of their methods. Bigotry, cruelty, and
tyranny at home, priestcraft and Jesuitism abroad,&ndash;&ndash;these,
O Khalid, you will know better by force of
contact before you end. And you will begin to pine
again for your iron-loined spiritual Mother. Ay, and
the scelerate Jesuit will even make capital of your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
mass of flowing hair. For in this country, only the
native priests are privileged to be shaggy and scrubby
and still be without suspicion. But we will let
Shakib give us a few not uninteresting details of the
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not long after we had rejoined our people,&#8221; he
writes, &#8220;Khalid comes to me with a sorry tale. In
truth, a fortnight after our arrival in Baalbek&ndash;&ndash;our
civility towards new comers seldom enjoys a longer
lease&ndash;&ndash;the town was alive with rumours and whim-whams
about my friend. And whereso I went, I was
not a little annoyed with the tehees and grunts which
his name seemed to invoke. The women often came to
his mother to inquire in particular why he grows his
hair and shaves his mustaches; the men would speak
to his father about the change in his accent and manners;
the children teheed and tittered whenever he
passed through the town-square; and all were of one
mind that Khalid was a worthless fellow, who had
brought nothing with him from the Paradise of the
New World but his cough and his fleece. Such tattle
and curiosity, however, no matter what degree of
savage vulgarity they reach, are quite harmless. But
I felt somewhat uneasy about him, when I heard the
people asking each other, &#8220;Why does he not come to
Church like honest folks?&#8221; And soon I discovered
that my apprehensions were well grounded; for the
questioning was noised at Khalid&#8217;s door, and the fire
crackled under the roof within. The father commands;
the mother begs; the father objurgates,
threatens, curses his son&#8217;s faith; and the mother, prostrating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
herself before the Virgin, weeps, and prays,
and beats her breast. Alas, and my Khalid? he
goes out on the terrace to search in the Nursery for
his favourite Plant. No, he does not find it;
brambles are there and noxious weeds galore. The
thorny, bitter reality he must now face, and, by
reason of his lack of savoir-faire, be ultimately out-faced
by it. For the upshot of the many quarrels he
had with his father, the prayers and tears of the
mother not availing, was nothing more or less than
banishment. You will either go to Church like myself,
or get out of this house: this the ultimatum of
Abu-Khalid. And needless to say which alternative
the son chose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still remember how agitated he was when he
came to tell me of the fatal breach. His words,
which drew tears from my eyes, I remember too.
&#8216;Homeless I am again,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but not friendless.
For besides Allah, I have you.&ndash;&ndash;Oh, this straitness
of the chest is going to kill me. I feel that my windpipe
is getting narrower every day. At least, my
father is doing his mighty best to make things so hard
and strait.&ndash;&ndash;Yes, I would have come now to bid you
farewell, were it not that I still have in this town some
important business. In the which I ask your help.
You know what it is. I have often spoken to you
about my cousin Najma, the one star in my sky.
And now, I would know what is its significance to
me. No, I can not leave Baalbek, I can not do anything,
until that star unfolds the night or the dawn
of my destiny. And you Shakib&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I promised to do what I could for
him. I offered him such cheer and comfort as my
home could boast of, which he would not accept. He
would have only my terrace roof on which to build
a booth of pine boughs, and spread in it a few straw
mats and cushions. But I was disappointed in my
calculations; for in having him thus near me again,
I had hoped to prevail upon him for his own good
to temper his behaviour, to conform a little, to concede
somewhat, while he is among his people. But
virtually he did not put up with me. He ate outside;
he spent his days I know not where; and when
he did come to his booth, it was late in the night. I
was informed later that one of the goatherds saw
him sleeping in the ruined Temple near Ras&#8217;ul-Ain.
And the muazzen who sleeps in the Mosque adjacent
to the Temple of Venus gave out that one night he
saw him with a woman in that very place.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman with Khalid, and in the Temple of
Venus at night? Be not too quick, O Reader, to
suspect and contemn; for the Venus-worship is not
reinstated in Baalbek. No tryst this, believe us, but
a scene pathetic, more sacred. Not Najma this
questionable companion, but one as dear to Khalid.
Ay, it is his mother come to seek him here. And she
begs him, in the name of the Virgin, to return home,
and try to do the will of his father. She beats her
breast, weeps, prostrates herself before him, beseeches,
implores, cries out, &#8216;dakhilak (I am at your
mercy), come home with me.&#8217; And Khalid, taking her
up by the arm, embraces her and weeps, but says not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
word. As two statues in the Temple, silent as an
autumn midnight, they remain thus locked in each
other&#8217;s arms, sobbing, mingling their sighs and tears.
The mother then, &#8216;Come, come home with me, O my
child.&#8217; And Khalid, sitting on one of the steps of
the Temple, replies, &#8216;Let him move out of the house,
and I will come. I will live with you, if he will
keep at the <ins class="trchange" title="Removed closing double-quote">Jesuits.&#8217;</ins></p>
<p>For Khalid begins to suspect that the Jesuits are
the cause of his banishment from home, that his
father&#8217;s religious ferocity is fuelled and fanned by
these good people. One day, before Khalid was
banished, Shakib tells us, one of them, Father
Farouche by name, comes to pay a visit of courtesy,
and finds Khalid sitting cross-legged on a mat writing
a letter.</p>
<p>The Padre is received by Khalid&#8217;s mother who
takes his hand, kisses it, and offers him the seat
of honour on the divan. Khalid continues writing.
And after he had finished, he turns round in his
cross-legged posture and greets his visitor. Which
greeting is surely to be followed by a conversation of
the sword-and-shield kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is your health?&#8221; this from Father Farouche
in miserable Arabic.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you see: I breathe with an effort, and can
hardly speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the health of the body is nothing compared
with the health of the soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that too well, O Reverend&#8221; (Ya
Muhtaram).
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And one must have recourse to the physician
in both instances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe in physicians, O Reverend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even the physician of the soul?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it, O Reverend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother of Khalid serves the coffee, and whispers
to her son a word. Whereupon Khalid rises
and sits on the divan near the Padre.</p>
<p>&#8220;But one must follow the religion of one&#8217;s father,&#8221;
the Jesuit resumes.</p>
<p>&#8220;When one&#8217;s father has a religion, yes; but
when he curses the religion of his son for not being
ferociously religious like himself&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a father must counsel and guide his children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the mother do that. Hers is the purest
and most disinterested spirit of the two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, why not obey your mother, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Khalid suppresses his anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother and I can get along without the
interference of our neighbours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, truly. But you will find great solace in
going to Church and ceasing your doubts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khalid rises indignant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only doubt the Pharisees, O Reverend, and
their Church I would destroy to-day if I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My child&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is your hat, O Reverend, and pardon
me&ndash;&ndash;you see, I can hardly speak, I can hardly
breathe. Good day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he walks out of the house, leaving Father
Farouche to digest his ire at his ease, and to wonder,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
with his three-cornered hat in hand, at the savage demeanour
of the son of their pious porter. &#8220;Your
son,&#8221; addressing the mother as he stands under the
door-lintel, &#8220;is not only an infidel, but he is also
crazy. And for such wretches there is an asylum
here and a Juhannam hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the poor mother, her face suffused with tears,
prostrates herself before the Virgin, praying, beating
her breast, invoking with her tongue and hand and
heart; while Farouche returns to his coop to hatch
under his three-cornered hat, the famous Jesuit-egg
of intrigue. That hat, which can outwit the monk&#8217;s
hood and the hundred fabled devils under it, that
hat, with its many gargoyles, a visible symbol of the
leaky conscience of the Jesuit, that hat, O Khalid,
which you would have kicked out of your house, has
eventually succeeded in ousting YOU, and will do
its mighty best yet to send you to the Bosphorus. Indeed,
to serve their purpose, these honest servitors of
Jesus will even act as spies to the criminal Government
of Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid. Read Shakib&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>&#8220;About a fortnight after Khalid&#8217;s banishment from
home,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;a booklet was published in Beirut,
setting forth the history of Ignatius Loyola and
the purports and intents of Jesuitism. On the cover
it was expressly declared that the booklet is translated
from the English, and the Jesuits, who are noted
for their scholarly attainments, could have discovered
this for themselves without the explicit declaration.
But they did not deem it necessary to make such a
discovery then. It seemed rather imperative to maintain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the contrary and try to prove it. Now, Khalid
having received a copy of this booklet from a friend
in Beirut, reads it and writes back, saying that it
is not a translation but a mutilation, rather, of one
of Thomas Carlyle&#8217;s Latter-Day Pamphlets entitled
<i>Jesuitism</i>. This letter must have reached them
together with Father Farouche&#8217;s report on Khalid&#8217;s
infidelity, just about the time the booklet was circulating
in Baalbek. For in the following Number of
their <i>Weekly Journal</i> an article, stuffed and padded
with execrations and anathema, is published against
the book and its anonymous author. From this I
quote the following, which is by no means the most
erring and most poisonous of their shafts.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Such a Pamphlet,&#8217; exclaims the scholarly Jesuit
Editor, &#8216;was never written by Thomas Carlyle, as
some here, from ignorance or malice, assert. For that
philosopher, of all the thinkers of his day, believed
in God and in the divinity of Jesus His Son, and
could never descend to these foul and filthy depths.
He never soiled his pen in the putrescence of falsehood
and incendiarism. The author of this blasphemous
and pernicious Pamphlet, therefore, in trying to
father his infidelity, his sedition, and his lies, on Carlyle,
is doubly guilty of a most heinous crime. And
we suspect, we know, and for the welfare of the community
we hope to be able soon to point out openly,
who and where this vile one is. Yes, only an atheist
and anarchist is capable of such villainous mendacity,
such unutterable wickedness and treachery. Now,
we would especially call upon our readers in Baalbek
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
to be watchful and vigilant, for among them is one,
recently come back from America, who harbours under
his bushy hair the atheism and anarchy of decadent
Europe, etc, etc.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is followed by secret orders from their
Head Office to the Superior of their Branch in Zahleh,
to go on with the work hinted in the article aforesaid.
Let it not be supposed that I make this statement
in jaundice or malice. For the man who was
instigated to do this foul work subsequently sold the
secret. And the Kaimkam, my friend, when speaking
to me of the matter, referred to the article in
question, and told me that Khalid was denounced to
the Government by the Jesuits as an anarchist. &#8216;And
lest I be compelled,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;to execute such
orders in his case as I might receive any day, I advise
you to spirit him away at once.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>But though the Jesuits have succeeded in kicking
Khalid out of his home, they did not succeed, thanks
to Shakib, in sending him to the Bosphorus. Meanwhile,
they sit quiet, hatching another egg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>FLOUNCES AND RUFFLES</h3>
</div>
<p>Now, that there is a lull in the machinations of
Jesuitry, we shall turn a page or two in Shakib&#8217;s
account of the courting of Khalid. And apparently
everything is propitious. The fates, at least, in the
beginning, are not unkind. For the feud between
Khalid&#8217;s father and uncle shall now help to forward
Khalid&#8217;s love-affair. Indeed, the father of Najma,
to spite his brother, opens to the banished nephew his
door and blinks at the spooning which follows. And
such an interminable yarn our Scribe spins out about
it, that Khalid and Najma do seem the silliest
lackadaisical spoonies under the sun. But what we
have evolved from the narration might have for our
readers some curious alien phase of interest.</p>
<p>Here then are a few beads from Shakib&#8217;s romantic
string. When Najma cooks <i>mojadderah</i> for her
father, he tells us, she never fails to come to the booth
of pine boughs with a platter of it. And this to
Khalid was very manna. For never, while supping
on this single dish, would he dream of the mensal
and kitchen luxuries of the Hermitage in Bronx Park.
In fact, he never envied the pork-eating Americans,
the beef-eating English, or the polyphagic French.
&#8220;Here is a dish of lentils fit for the gods,&#8221; he would
say....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>When Najma goes to the spring for water, Khalid
chancing to meet her, takes the jar from her shoulder,
saying, &#8220;Return thou home; I will bring thee
water.&#8221; And straightway to the spring hies he,
where the women there gathered fill his ears with
tittering, questioning tattle as he is filling his jar. &#8220;I
wish I were Najma,&#8221; says one, as he passes by, the
jar of water on his shoulder. &#8220;Would you cement
his brain, if you were?&#8221; puts in another. And thus
would they gibe and joke every time Khalid came to
the spring with Najma&#8217;s jar....</p>
<p>One day he comes to his uncle&#8217;s house and finds
his betrothed ribboning and beading some new lingerie
for her rich neighbour&#8217;s daughter. He sits
down and helps her in the work, writing meanwhile,
between the acts, an alphabetic ideology on Art and
Life. But as they are beading the vests and skirts
and other articles of richly laced linen underwear,
Najma holds up one of these and na&iuml;vely asks, &#8220;Am
I not to have some such, <i>ya habibi</i> (O my Love)?&#8221;
And Khalid, affecting like bucolic innocence, replies,
&#8220;What do we need them for, my heart?&#8221; With
which counter-question Najma is silenced, convinced.</p>
<p>Finally, to show to what degree of ecstasy they had
soared without searing their wings or losing a single
feather thereof, the following deserves mention. In
the dusk one day, Khalid visits Najma and finds her
oiling and lighting the lamp. As she beholds him under
the door-lintel, the lamp falls from her hands, the
kerosene blazes on the floor, and the straw mat takes
fire. They do not heed this&ndash;&ndash;they do not see it&ndash;&ndash;they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
are on the wings of an ecstatic embrace. And
the father, chancing to arrive in the nick of time, with
a curse and a cuff, saves them and his house from the
conflagration.</p>
<p>Aside from these curious and not insignificant instances,
these radiations of a giddy hidden flame of
heart-fire, this melting gum of spooning on the bark
of the tree of love, we turn to a scene in the Temple
of Venus which unfolds our future plans&ndash;&ndash;our
hopes and dreams. But we feel that the Reader is
beginning to hanker for a few pieces of description of
Najma&#8217;s charms. Gentle Reader, this Work is
neither a Novel, nor a Passport. And we are exceeding
sorry we can not tell you anything about the
colour and size of Najma&#8217;s eyes; the shape and curves
of her brows and lips; the tints and shades in her
cheeks; and the exact length of her figure and hair.
Shakib leaves us in the dark about these essentials,
and we must needs likewise leave you. Our Scribe
thinks he has said everything when he speaks of her
as a huri. But this paradisal title among our Arabic
writers and verse-makers is become worse than the
Sultan&#8217;s Medjidi decorations. It is bestowed alike on
every drab and trollop as on the very few who really
deserve it. Let us rank it, therefore, with the
Medjidi decorations and pass on.</p>
<p>But Khalid, who has seen enough of the fair, would
not be attracted to Najma, enchanted by her, if she
were not endowed with such of the celestial treasures
as rank above the visible lines of beauty. Our Scribe
speaks of the &#8220;purity and na&iuml;vete of her soul as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
purest sources of felicity and inspiration.&#8221; Indeed, if
she were not constant in love, she would not have
spurned the many opportunities in the absence of
Khalid; and had she not a fine discerning sense of
real worth, she would not have surrendered herself to
her poor ostracised cousin; and if she were not intuitively,
preternaturally wise, she would not marry an
enemy of the Jesuits, a bearer withal of infiltrated
lungs and a shrunken windpipe. &#8220;There is a great
advantage in having a sickly husband,&#8221; she once said
to Shakib, &#8220;it lessons a woman in the heavenly virtues
of our Virgin Mother, in patient endurance and
pity, in charity, magnanimity, and pure love.&#8221; What,
with these sublimities of character, need we know of
her visible charms, or lack of them? She might deserve
the title Shakib bestows upon her; she might be
a real huri, for all we know? In that event, the outward
charms correspond, and Khalid is a lucky dog&ndash;&ndash;if
some one can keep the Jesuits away.</p>
<p>This, then, is our picture of Najma, to whom he is
now relating, in the Temple of Venus, of the dangers
he had passed and the felicities of the beduin life he
has in view. It is evening. The moon struggles
through the poplars to light the Temple for them, and
the ambrosial breeze caresses their cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says Khalid; &#8220;we can not live here, O my
Heart, after we are formally married. The curse in
my breast I must not let you share, and only when I
am rid of it am I actually your husband. By the life
of this blessed night, by the light of these stars, I am
inalterably resolved on this, and I shall abide by my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
resolution. We must leave Baalbek as soon as the
religious formalities are done. And I wish your
father would have them performed under his roof.
That is as good as going to Church to be the central
figures of the mummery of priests. But be this as
You will. Whether in Church or at home, whether
by your father or by gibbering Levites the ceremony
is performed, we must hie us to the desert after it is
done. I shall hire the camels and prepare the necessary
set-out for the wayfare a day or two ahead. No,
I must not be a burden to you, my Heart. I must be
able to work for you as for myself. And Allah
alone, through the ministration of his great Handmaid
Nature, can cure me and enable me to share with you
the joys of life. No, not before I am cured, can I
give you my whole self, can I call myself your husband.
Into the desert, therefore, to some oasis in its
very heart, we shall ride, and there crouch our camels
and establish ourselves as husbandmen. I shall even
build you a little home like your own. And you will
be to me an aura of health, which I shall breathe with
the desert air, and the evening breeze. Yes, our love
shall dwell in a palace of health, not in a hovel of
disease. Meanwhile, we shall buy with what money
I have a little patch of ground which we shall cultivate
together. And we shall own cattle and drink
camel milk. And we shall doze in the afternoon in
the cool shade of the palms, and in the evening, wrapt
in our cloaks, we&#8217;ll sleep on the sands under the living
stars. Yes, and Najma shall be the harbinger
of dawn to Khalid.&ndash;&ndash;Out on that little farm in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
oasis of our desert, far from the world and the sanctified
abominations of the world, we shall live near to
Allah a life of purest joy, of true happiness. We
shall never worry about the hopes of to-morrow and
the gone blessings of yesterday. We shall not, while
labouring, dream of rest, nor shall we give a thought
to our tasks while drinking of the cup of repose: each
hour shall be to us an epitome of eternity. The trials
and troubles of each day shall go with the setting sun,
never to rise with him again. But I am unkind to
speak of this. For your glances banish care, and we
shall ever be together. Ay, my Heart, and when I
take up the lute in the evening, you&#8217;ll sing <i>mulayiah</i>
to me, and the stars above us shall dance, and the
desert breeze shall house us in its whispers of
love....&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus interminably, while Najma, understanding
little of all this, sits beside him on a fallen column
in the Temple and punctuates his words with assenting
exclamations, with long eighs of joy and wonder.
&#8220;But we are not going to live in the desert all the
time, are we?&#8221; she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my Heart. When I am cured of my illness
we shall return to Baalbek, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eigh, good. Now, I want to say&ndash;&ndash;no. I
shame to speak about such matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak, <i>ya Gazalty</i> (O my Doe or Dawn or
both); your words are like the scented breeze, like
the ethereal moon rays, which enter into this Temple
without permission. Speak, and light up this ruined
Temple of thine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How sweet are Your words, but really I
can not understand them. They are like the <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'sweet-meats' across lines">sweetmeats</ins>
my father brought with him once from Damascus.
One eats and exclaims, &#8216;How delicious!&#8217;
But one never knows how they are made, and what
they are made of. I wish I could speak like you,
<i>ya habibi</i>. I would not shame to say then what I
want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say what you wish. My heart is open, and your
words are silvery moonbeams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not blame me then. I am so simple, you
know, so foolish. And I would like to know if you
are going to Church on our wedding day in the
clothes you have on now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you object to them, my Heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eigh, good! And must I come in my ordinary
Sunday dress? It is so plain; it has not a single
ruffle to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are ruffles for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw a bride in a plain gown; they all
have ruffles and flounces to them. And when I look
at your lovely hair&ndash;&ndash;O let people say what they
like! A gown without ruffles is ugly.&ndash;&ndash;So, you will
buy me a sky-blue silk dress, <i>ya habibi</i> and a pink one,
too, with plenty of ruffles on them? Will you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my Heart, you shall have what you desire.
But in the desert you can not wear these dresses.
The Arabs will laugh at you. For the women there
wear only plain muslin dipped in indigo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I will have but one dress of sky-blue silk
for the wedding.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, my Heart. And the ruffles shall be
as many and as long as you desire them.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the many-ruffled sky-blue dress is being
made, Khalid, inspired by Najma&#8217;s remarks on his hair,
rhapsodises on flounces and ruffles. Of this striking
piece of fantasy, in which are scintillations of the great
Truth, we note the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;What can you do without your flounces? How
can you live without your ruffles? Ay, how can you,
without them, think, speak, or work? How can you
eat, drink, walk, sleep, pray, worship, moralise, sentimentalise,
or love, without them? Are you not
ruffled and flounced when you first see the light,
ruffled and flounced when you last see the darkness?
The cradle and the tomb, are they not the first and
last ruffles of Man? And between them what a
panoramic display of flounces! What clean and attractive
visible Edges of unclean invisible common
Skirts! Look at your huge elaborate monuments,
your fancy sepulchers, what are they but the
ruffles of your triumphs and defeats? The marble
flounces, these, of your cemeteries, your Pantheons and
Westminster Abbeys. And what are your belfries
and spires and chimes, your altars and reredoses and
such like, but the sanctified flounces of your churches.
No, these are not wholly adventitious sanctities; not
empty, superfluous growths. They are incorporated
into Life by Time, and they grow in importance as our
&AElig;sthetics become more inutile, as our Religions begin
to exude gum and pitch for commerce, instead of bearing
fruits of Faith and Love and Magnanimity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The first church was the forest; the first dome, the
welkin; the first altar, the sun. But that was, when
man went forth in native buff, brother to the lion,
not the ox, without ruffles and without faith. His
spirit, in the course of time, was born; it grew and
developed zenithward and nadirward, as the cycles
rolled on. And in spiritual pride, and pride of power
and wealth as well, it took to ruffling and flouncing
to such an extent that at certain epochs it disappeared,
dwindled into nothingness, and only the
appendages remained. These were significant appendages,
to be sure; not altogether adscititious. Ruffles
these, indeed, endowed, as it were, with life, and
growing on the dead Spirit, as the grass on the grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is it not noteworthy that our life terrene at
certain epochs seems to be made up wholly of these?
That as the great Pine falls, the noxious weeds, the
brambles and thorny bushes around it, grow quicker,
lustier, luxuriating on the vital stores in the earth
that were its own&ndash;&ndash;is not this striking and perplexing,
my rational friends? Surely, Man is neither the
featherless biped of the Greek Philosopher, nor the
tool-using animal of the Sage of Chelsea. For animals,
too, have their tools, and man, in his visible
flounces, has feathers enough to make even a peacock
gape. Both my Philosophers have hit wide of the
mark this time. And Man, to my way of thinking, is
a flounce-wearing Spirit. Indeed, flounces alone, the
invisible ones in particular, distinguish us from the
beasts. For like ourselves they have their fashions in
clothes; their peculiar speech; their own hidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
means of intellection, and, to some extent, of imagination:
but flounces they have not, they know not.
These are luxuries, which Man alone enjoys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Man,&ndash;&ndash;thou son and slave of Allah, according
to my Oriental Prophets of Heaven; thou exalted,
apotheosised ape, according to my Occidental Prophets
of Science;&ndash;&ndash;how much thou canst suffer, how much
thou canst endure, under what pressure and in what
Juhannam depths thou canst live; but thy flounces
thou canst not dispense with for a day, nor for a single
one-twelfth part of a day. Even in thy suffering and
pain, the agonised spirit is wrapped, bandaged,
swathed in ruffles. It is assuaged with the flounces
of thy lady&#8217;s caresses, and the scalloped intonations of
her soft and soothing voice. It is humbugged into
health by the malodorous flounces of the apothecary
and the medicinal ruffles of the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, we live in a phantasmagoric, cycloramic economy
of flounces and ruffles. The human Spirit shirks
nudity as it shirks pain. Even your modern preacher
of the Simple Life is at best suggesting the moderate
use of ruffles.... Indeed, we can suffer anything,
everything, but the naked and ugly reality.
Alas, have I not listened for years to what I mistook
to be the strong, pure voice of the naked Truth? And
have I not discovered, to my astonishment, that the
supposed scientific Nudity is but an indurated thick
Crust under which the Lie lies hidden. Why strip
Man of his fancy appendages, his adventitious sanctities,
if you are going to give him instead only a few
yards of shoddy? No, I tell you; this can not be done.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Your brambles and thorn hedges will continue to grow
and luxuriate, will even shut from your view the Temple
in the Grove, until the great Pine rises again to
stunt, and ultimately extirpate, them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold, meanwhile, how the world parades in ruffles
before us. What a bewildering phantasmagoria
this: a very Dress Ball of the human race. See them
pass: the Pope of Christendom, in his three hats and
heavy trailing gowns, blessing the air of heaven; the
priest, in his alb and chasuble, dispensing of the blessings
of the Pope; the judge, in his wig and bombazine,
endeavouring to reconcile divine justice with the law&#8217;s
mundane majesty; the college doctor, in cap and gown,
anointing the young princes of knowledge; the buffoon,
in his cap and bells, dancing to the god of laughter;
mylady of the pink-tea circle, in her huffing, puffing
gasoline-car, fleeing the monster of ennui; the bride
and bridegroom at the altar or before the mayor putting
on their already heavy-ruffled garments the sacred
ruffle of law or religion; the babe brought to church by
his mother and kindred to have the priest-tailor sew on
his new garment the ruffle of baptism; the soldier in
his gaudy uniform; the king in his ermine with a crown
and sceptre appended; the Nabob of Ind in his gorgeous
and multi-colored robes; and the Papuan with
horns in his nostrils and rings in his ears: see them all
pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;And wilt thou still add to the bewildering variety
of the pageant? Or wilt have another of the higher
things of the mind? Lo, the artist this, wearing his
ruffles of hair over his shoulders; and here, too, is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
man of the sombrero and red flannel, which are the
latest flounces of a certain set of New World poets.
Directly behind them is Dame Religion with her heavy
ruffled robes, her beribboned and belaced bodices, her
ornaments and sacred gewgaws. And billah, she has
stuffings and paddings, too. And false teeth and foul
breath! Never mind. Pass on, and let her pass. But
tarry thou a moment here. Behold this pyrotechnic
display, these buntings and flags; hear thou this music
and these shouts and cheers; on yonder stump is an
orator dispensing to his fellow citizens spread-eagle
rhetoric as empty as yonder drum: these are the elaborate
and attractive ruffles of politics. And among
the crowd are genial and honest citizens who have their
own way of ruffling your temper with their coarse
flounces of linsey-woolsey freedom. Wilt thou have
more?&#8221;</p>
<p>Decidedly not, we reply. For how can we even
keep company with Khalid, who has become such a
maniac on flounces? And was this fantastic, phantasmagoric
rhapsody all inspired by Najma&#8217;s simple
remark on his hair? Fruitful is thy word, O woman!</p>
<p>But being so far away now from the Hermitage in
the Bronx, what has the &#8220;cherry in the cocktail&#8221; and
&#8220;the olive in the oyster patty&#8221; to do with all this?
Howbeit, the following deserves a place as the tail-flounce
of his Fantasy.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Your superman and superwoman,&#8221; says he, with
philosophic calm, &#8220;may go Adam-and-Eve like if
they choose. But can they, even in that chaste and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
splendid nudity, dispense with ruffles and flounces?
Pray, tell me, did not our first parents spoon and
sentimentalise in the Paradise, before the Serpent
appeared? And would they not often whisper unto
each other, &#8216;Ah, Adam, ah, <ins class="trchange" title="Added closing single-quote">Eve!&#8217;</ins> sighing likewise
for sweeter things? And what about those fatal
Apples, those two sour fruits of their Love?&ndash;&ndash;I tell
thee every new-born babe is the magnificent flesh-flounce
of a shivering, trembling, nudity. And I
Khalid, what am I but the visible ruffle of an invisible
skirt? Verily, I am; and thou, too, my Brother.
Yea, and this aquaterrestrial globe and these sidereal
heavens are the divine flounces of the Vesture of
Allah.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE HOWDAJ OF FALSEHOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Humanity is so feeble in mind,&#8221; says Renan,
&#8220;that the purest thing has need of the co-operation
of some impure agent.&#8221; And this, we think,
is the gist of Khalid&#8217;s rhapsody on flounces and
ruffles. But how is he to reconcile the fact with
the truth in his case? For a single sanctified ruffle&ndash;&ndash;a
line of type in the canon law&ndash;&ndash;is likely to upset
all his plans. Yes, a priest in alb and chasuble
not only can dispense with the blessings of his Pope,
but&ndash;&ndash;and here is the rub&ndash;&ndash;he can also withhold
such blessings from Khalid. And now, do what he
may, say what he might, he must either revise his
creed, or behave, at least, like a Christian.</p>
<p>Everything is ready, you say? The sky-blue,
many-ruffled wedding gown; the set-out for the wayfare;
the camel and donkeys; the little stock of books;
the coffee utensils; the lentils and sweet oil;&ndash;&ndash;all
ready? Very well; but you can not set forth to-morrow,
nor three weeks from to-morrow. Indeed,
before the priest can give you his blessings&ndash;&ndash;and
what at this juncture can you do without them?&ndash;&ndash;the
dispensations of the ban must be performed. In
other words, your case must now be laid before the
community. Every Sunday, for three such to come,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
the intended marriage of Khalid to Najma will be
published in the Church, and whoso hath any objection
to make can come forth and make it. Moreover,
there is that little knot of consanguinity to be considered.
And your priest is good enough to come and
explain this to you. Understand him well. &#8220;An
alm of a few gold pieces,&#8221; says he, &#8220;will remove the
obstacle; the unlawfulness of your marriage resulting
from consanguinity will cease on payment of five hundred
piasters.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of which startles Khalid, stupefies him. He had
not, heretofore, thought of such a matter. Indeed, he
was totally ignorant of these forms, these prohibitions
and exemptions of the Church. And the father of
Najma, though assenting, remarks nevertheless that
the alms demanded are much. &#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaims
Khalid, &#8220;I can build a house for five hundred
piasters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest sits down cross-legged on the divan,
lights the cigarette which Najma had offered with
the coffee, and tries to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where have you this, O Reverend, about
consanguinity, prohibition, and alms!&#8221; Khalid asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, my child, in the Canons of our Church,
Catholic and Apostolic. Every one knows that a
marriage between cousins can not be effected, without
the sanction of the Bishop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can we not obtain this sanction without paying
for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not paying for it, my child; you
are only contributing some alms to the Church.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You come to us, therefore, as a beggar, not as
a spiritual father and guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not good speaking. You misunderstand
my purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And pray, tell me, what is the purpose of prohibiting
a marriage between cousins; what chief good
is there in such a ban?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much good for the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have nothing to do with the community.
I&#8217;m going to live with my wife in the desert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The good of your souls is chiefly concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the good of our souls!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there are other reasons which can not be
freely spoken of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the restriction and prohibition of
sexual knowledge between relatives. That is very
well. But let us return to what concerns us
properly: the good of my soul, and the spiritual well-being
of the community,&ndash;&ndash;what becomes of these,
when I pay the prescribed alms and obtain the sanction
of the Bishop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No harm then can come to them&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;ll be
secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Secure, you say? Are they not hazarded, sold
by your Church for five hundred piasters? If my
marriage to my cousin be wrong, unlawful, your
Bishop in sanctioning same is guilty of perpetuating
this wrong, this unlawfulness, is he not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what the Church binds only the Church can
loosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is the use of binding, O Reverend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
Father, when a little sum of money can loosen anything
you bind? It seems to me that these prohibitions
of the Church are only made for the purpose of
collecting alms. In other words, you bind for the
sake of loosening, when a good bait is on the hook, do
you not? Pardon, O my Reverend Father, pardon. I
can not, to save my soul and yours, reconcile these
contradictions. For if Mother Church be certain
that my marriage to my cousin is contrary to the Law
of God, is destructive of my spiritual well-being, then
let her by all means prohibit it. Let her restrain me,
compel me to obey. Ay, and the police ought to interfere
in case of disobedience. In her behalf, in
my behalf, in the behalf of my cousin&#8217;s soul and mine,
the police ought to do the will of God, if the Church
knows what it is, and is certain and honest about
it. Compel me to stop, I conjure you, if you know
I am going in the way of damnation. O my Father,
what sort of a mother is she who would sell two of
her children to the devil for a few hundred piasters?
No, billah! no. What is unlawful by virtue of the
Divine Law the wealth of all the Trust-Kings of
America can not make lawful. And what is so
by virtue of your Canon Law concerns not me. You
may angle, you and your Church, as long as you
please in the murky, muddy waters of Bind-and-Loosen,
I have nothing to do with you.&#8221;...</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>But the priests, O Khalid, have yet a little to do
with you. Such arguments about the Divine Law
and the Canon Law, about alms and spiritual beggars,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
might cut the Gordian knot with your uncle, but&ndash;&ndash;and
whether it be good or bad English, we say it&ndash;&ndash;they
cut no ice with the Church. Yes, Mother
Church, under whose wings you and your cousin
were born and bred, and under whose wings you and
your cousin would be married, can not take off for the
sweet sake of your black eyes the ruffles and flounces
of twenty centuries. Think well on it, you who have
so extravagantly and not unwisely delivered yourself
on flounces and ruffles. But to think, when in love,
were, indeed, disastrous. O Love, Love, what
Camels of wisdom thou canst force to pass through
the needle&#8217;s eye! What miracles divine are thine!
Khalid himself says that to be truly, deeply, piously
in love, one must needs hate himself. How true,
how inexorably true! For would he be always inviting
trouble and courting affliction, would he be
always bucking against the dead wall of a Democracy
or a Church, if he did not sincerely hate himself&ndash;&ndash;if
he were not religiously, fanatically in love&ndash;&ndash;in love
with Najma, if not with Truth?</p>
<p>Now, on the following Sunday, instead of publishing
the intended marriage of Khalid and Najma, the
parish priest places a ban upon it. And in this, ye
people of Baalbek, is food enough for tattle, and
cause enough for persecution. Potent are the ruffles
of the Church! But why, we can almost hear the
anxious Reader asking, if the camels are ready, why
the deuce don&#8217;t they get on and get them gone? But
did we not say once that Khalid is slow, even slower
than the law itself? Nevertheless, if this were a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Novel, an elopement would be in order, but we must
repeat, it is not. We are faithful transcribers of the
truth as we find it set down in Shakib&#8217;s <i>Histoire
Intime</i>.</p>
<p>True, Khalid did ask Najma to throw with him
the handful of dust, to steal out of Baalbek and get
married on the way, say in Damascus. But poor
Najma goes over to his mother instead, and mingling
their tears and prayers, they beseech the Virgin to
enlighten the soul and mind of Khalid. &#8220;Yes, we
must be married here, before we go to the desert,&#8221;
says she, &#8220;for think, O my mother, how far away we
shall be from the world and the Church if anything
happens to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they would have succeeded, the mother and
cousin of Khalid, in persuading the parish priest to
accept from them the prescribed alms and perform the
wedding ceremony, had not the Jesuits, in the interest
of the Faith and the Church, been dogging
Khalid still. For if they have failed in sending him
to the Bosphorus, they will succeed in sending him
elsewhither. And observe how this is done.</p>
<p>After communicating with the Papal Legate in Mt.
Lebanon about that fatal Latter Day Pamphlet of
Thomas Carlyle, the Adjutant-General, or Adjutant-Bird,
stalks up there one night in person and lays
before the Rt. Rev. Mgr. his devil&#8217;s brief in Khalid&#8217;s
case. It has already been explained that this Pamphlet
was fathered on Khalid by the Jesuits. For if they can
not punish the Voice which is still pursuing them&ndash;&ndash;and
in their heart of hearts they must have recognised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
its thunder, even in a Translation&ndash;&ndash;they will make
the man smart for it who first mentioned Carlyle in
this connection.</p>
<p>&#8220;And besides this pernicious booklet,&#8221; says the
Adjutant-Bird, &#8220;the young man&#8217;s heretical opinions
are notorious. He was banished from home on that
account. And now, after corrupting and deluding
his cousin, he is going to marry her despite the ban of
the Church. Something, Monseigneur, ought to be
done, and quickly, to protect the community against
the poison of this wretch.&#8221; And Monseigneur, nodding
his accord, orders his Secretary to write a note
to the Patriarch, enclosing the aforesaid devil&#8217;s brief,
and showing the propriety, nay, the necessity of excommunicating
Khalid the Baalbekian. The Adjutant-Bird,
with the Legate&#8217;s letter in his pocket, skips over
to the Patriarch on the other hill-top below, and after
a brief interview&ndash;&ndash;our dear good Ancient of the
Maronites must willy-nilly obey Rome&ndash;&ndash;the fate of
Khalid the Baalbekian is sealed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the upshot of these Jesuitic machinations is
this: on the very day when Khalid&#8217;s mother and cousin
are pleading before the parish priest for justice, for
mercy,&ndash;&ndash;offering the prescribed alms, beseeching that
the ban be revoked, the marriage solemnised,&ndash;&ndash;a
messenger from the Bishop of the Diocese enters,
kisses his Reverence&#8217;s hand, and delivers an imposing
envelope. The priest unseals it, unfolds the heavy
foolscap sheet therein, reads it with a knitting of the
brow, a shaking of the beard, and, clapping one hand
upon the other, tells the poor pleaders to go home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is all finished. There is no more hope for you
and your cousin.&#8221; And he shows the Patriarchal
Bull, and explains.</p>
<p>Whereupon, Najma and Khalid&#8217;s mother go out
weeping, wailing, beating their breasts and cheeks,
calling upon Allah to witness their sorrow and the outrageous
tyranny of the priests.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has my son done to be excommunicated?
Hear it, ye people, hear it. And be just to me and
my son. What has he done to deserve the anathema
of the Church? What has he done?&#8221; And thus
frantic, mad, she runs through the main street of the
town, making wild gestures and clamours,&ndash;&ndash;publishing,
as it were, the Patriarchal Bull, before it was
read by the priest on the following day, and tacked
on the door of the Church.</p>
<p>Of this Bull, tricked with the stock phrases of the
Church of the Middle Ages, such as &#8220;anathema be
he,&#8221; or &#8220;banned be he,&#8221; who speaks with, deals with,
and so forth, we have a copy before us. But our
readers will not pardon us, we fear, if further space
and consideration be here given to its contents. Suffice
it to say, however, that Khalid comes to church
on that fatal day, takes the foolscap sheet down from
the door, and, going with it to the town-square, burns
it there before the multitudes.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the Bull is burned in the
town-square of Baalbek, in the last year of the reign
of Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid, some among the multitudes shout
loud shouts of joy, and some cast stones.</p>
<p>Then, foul, vehement speaking falleth between the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
friends and the enemies of him who wrought evil in
the sight of the Lord;</p>
<p>And every one thereupon brandisheth a stick or
taketh up a stone and the battle ensueth.</p>
<p>Now, the mighty troops of the Sultan of the Ottomans
come forth like the Yaman wind and stand in
the town-square like rocks;</p>
<p>And the battle rageth still, and the troops who are
come forth to part the fighting multitudes, having
gorged themselves at the last meal, can not as much
as speak their part:</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the clubs and spades are
veiled and the battle subsideth of itself, the good
people return to their respective callings and trades;</p>
<p>But the perverse recalcitrants which remain&ndash;&ndash;and
Khalid the Baalbekian is among them&ndash;&ndash;are taken
by the aforesaid overfed troops to the City Hall and
thence to the <i>velayet</i> prison in Damascus.</p>
<p>And here endeth our stichometrics of the Battle of
the Bull.</p>
<p>Now, Shakib may wear out his shoes this time, his
tongue, too, and his purse, but to no purpose. Behold,
your friend the <i>kaimkam</i> is gloomy and impassive
as a camel; what can you do? Whisper in his
ear? The Padres have done that before you. Slip
a purse into his pocket? They have done that, too,
and overdone it long since. Yes, the City Hall of
every city in the Empire is an epitome of Yildiz
Kiosk. And your <i>kaimkams</i>, and <i>valis</i>, and <i>viziers</i>,
have all been taught in the same Text-Book, at the
same Political School, and by the same Professor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Let Khalid rest, therefore and ponder these matters in
silence. For in the City Hall and during the month
he passes in the prison of Damascus, we are told, he
does not utter a word. His partisans in prison ask to
be taught his creed, and among these are some Mohammadans:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll burn the priests and their
church yet and follow you. By our Prophet Mohammad
we will ...&#8221; Khalid makes no <ins class="trchange" title="Changed ',' to '.'">reply.</ins>
Even Shakib, when he comes to visit him, finds him
dumb as a stone, slain by adversity and disease.
Nothing can be done now. The giant excommunicated,
incommunicative soul, struggling in a prison of
sore flesh, we must leave, alas, with his friends and
partisans to pass his thirty days and nights in the
second prison of stone.</p>
<p>Now, let us return to the Jesuits, who, having
worsted Khalid, or the Devil in Khalid, as they charitably
put it, will also endeavour to do somewhat in the
interest of his intended bride. For the Padres, in addition
to their many crafts and trades, are matrimonial
brokers of honourable repute. And in their meddling
and making, their baiting and mating, they are as serviceable
as the Column Personal of an American newspaper.
Whoso is matrimonially disposed shall whisper
his mind at the Confessional or drop his advertisement
in the pocket of the visiting Columns of their
Bride-Dealer, and he shall prosper. She as well as
he shall prosper.</p>
<p>Now, Father Farouche is commissioned to come all
the way from Zahleh to visit the brother of Abu-Khalid
their porter, and bespeak him in the interest of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
daughter. All their faculties of persuasion shall be
exerted in behalf of Najma. She must be saved at
any cost. Hence they volunteer their services. And
while Khalid is lingering in prison at Damascus, they
avail themselves of the opportunity to further the suit
of their pickle-herring candidate for Najma&#8217;s love.</p>
<p>The Reverend Farouche, therefore, holds a secret
conference with her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says he, &#8220;God would never have forgiven you
for giving your daughter to one utterly destitute of
morality, religion, money, and health. But praise Allah!
the Church has come to her rescue. She shall be
saved, wrested from the hands of Iblis. Yes, Holy
Church, through us, will guide her to find a god-fearing
life-companion; one worthy of her charms, her
virtues, her fine qualities of heart and mind. The
young man we recommend is rich, respected in the
community; is an official of the Government with a
third-class Medjidi decoration and the title of Bey;
and is free from all diseases. Moreover, he is a good
Catholic. Consider these advantages. A relation
this, which no father would reject, if he loves his
daughter and is solicitous of her future well-being.
Speak to her, therefore, and let us know soon your
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>And our Scribe, in relating of this, loses his temper.&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;An
Official of the Government, a Bey with a third-class
Medjidi decoration from the Sultan! As if
Officialdom could not boast of a single scoundrel&ndash;&ndash;as
if any rogue in the Empire, with a few gold coins
in his purse, were not eligible to the Hamidian decorations!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
And a third-class decoration! Why, I have
it on good authority that these Medjidi Orders were
given to a certain Patriarch in a bushel to distribute
among his minions....&#8221;</p>
<p>But to our subject. Abu-Najma does not look
upon it in this light. A decorated and titled son-in-law
were a great honour devoutly to be wished. And
some days after the first conference, the Padre
Farouche comes again, bringing along his Excellency
the third-class Medjidi Bey; but Najma, as they enter
and salaam, goes out on the terrace roof to weep.
The third time the third-class Medjidi Dodo comes
alone. And Najma, as soon as she catches a glimpse
of him, takes up her earthen jar and hies her to the
spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;O the hinny! I&#8217;ll rope noose her (hang her) to-night,&#8221;
murmurs the father. But here is his Excellency
with his Sultan&#8217;s green button in his lapel.
Abu-Najma bows low, rubs his hands well, offers a
large cushion, brings a <i>masnad</i> (leaning pillow), and
blubbers out many unnecessary apologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This honour is great, your Excellency&ndash;&ndash;overlook
our shortcomings&ndash;&ndash;our <i>beit</i> (one room house)
can not contain our shame&ndash;&ndash;it is not becoming your
Excellency&#8217;s high rank&ndash;&ndash;overlook&ndash;&ndash;you have condescended
to honour us, condescend too to be indulgent.&ndash;&ndash;My
daughter? yes, presently. She is gone to
church, to mass, but she&#8217;ll return soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Najma is long gone; returns not; and the
third-class Dodo will call again to-morrow. Now,
Abu-Najma brings out his rope, soaps it well, nooses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
and suspends it from the rafter in the ceiling. And
when his daughter returns from the spring, he takes
her by the arm, shows her the rope, and tells her
laconically to choose between his Excellency and this.
Poor Najma has not the courage to die, and so soon.
Her cousin Khalid is in prison, is excommunicated&ndash;&ndash;what
can she do? Run away? The Church will
follow her&ndash;&ndash;punish her. There&#8217;s something satanic
in Khalid&ndash;&ndash;the Church said so&ndash;&ndash;the Church knows.
Najma rolls these things in her mind, looks at her
father beseechingly. Her father points to the noose.
Najma falls to weeping. The noose serves well its
purpose.</p>
<p>For hereafter, when the Dodo comes decorated,
SHE has to offer him the cushion, bring him the
<i>masnad</i>, make for him the coffee. And eventually, as
the visits accumulate, she goes with him to the dress-maker
in Beirut. The bridal gown shall be of the
conventional silk this time; for his Excellency is
travelled, and knows and reverences the fashion. But
why prolong these painful details?</p>
<p>&#8220;Allah, in the mysterious working of his Providence,&#8221;
says Shakib, &#8220;preordained it thus: Khalid,
having served his turn in prison, Najma begins her
own; for a few days after he was set free, she was
placed in bonds forged for her by the Jesuits. Now,
when Khalid returned from Damascus, he came
straightway to me and asked that we go to see
Najma and try to prevail upon her, to persuade her
to go with him, to run away. They would leave on
the night-train to Hama this time, and thence set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
forth towards Palmyra. I myself did not know what
had happened, and so I approved of his plan. But
alas! as we were coming down the main Street to
Najma&#8217;s house, we heard the sound of tomtoms in the
distance and the shrill ulluluing of women. We continued
apace until we reached the by-way through
which we had to pass, and lo, we find it choked by
the <i>zeffah</i> (wedding <ins class="trchange" title="Removed extra ')'">procession)</ins> of none but she and
the third-class Medjidi....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>But we&#8217;ll no more of this! Too tragic, too much
like fiction it sounds, that here abruptly we must end
this Chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE KAABA OF SOLITUDE</h3>
</div>
<p>Disappointed, distraught, diseased,&ndash;&ndash;worsted
by the Jesuits, excommunicated, crossed in love,&ndash;&ndash;but
with an eternal glint of sunshine in
his breast to open and light up new paths before him,
Khalid, after the fatal episode, makes away from
Baalbek. He suddenly disappears. But where he
lays his staff, where he spends his months of solitude,
neither Shakib nor our old friend the sandomancer can
say. Somewhither he still is, indeed; for though he
fell in a swoon as he saw Najma on her caparisoned
palfrey and the decorated Excellency coming up along
side of her, he was revived soon after and persuaded
to return home. But on the following morning, our
Scribe tells us, coming up to the booth, he finds
neither Khalid there, nor any of his few worldly belongings.
We, however, have formed a theory of our
own, based on certain of his writings in the K. L. MS.,
about his mysterious levitation; and we believe
he is now somewhither whittling arrows for a coming
combat. In the Lebanon mountains perhaps. But
we must not dog him like the Jesuits. Rather let us
reverence the privacy of man, the sacredness of his
religious retreat. For no matter where he is in the
flesh, we are metaphysically certain of his existence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
And instead of filling up this Chapter with the bitter
bickerings of life and the wickedness and machination
of those in power, let us consecrate it to the divine
peace and beauty of Nature. Of a number of Chapters
in the Book of Khalid on this subject, we choose
the one entitled, My Native Terraces, or Spring in
Syria, symbolising the natural succession to Khalid&#8217;s
Winter of destiny. In it are signal manifestations
of the triumph of the soul over the diseases and
adversities and sorrows of mortal life. Indeed, here
is an example of faith and power and love which we
reckon sublime.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;The inhabitants of my terraces and terrace walls,&#8221;
we translate, &#8220;dressed in their Sunday best, are in
the doorways lounging or peeping idly through their
windows. And why not? It is Spring, and to these
delicate, sweet little creatures, Spring is the one Sunday
of the year. Have they not hugged the damp,
dark earth long enough? Hidden from the wrath of
Winter, have they not squatted patiently round the
primitive, smokeless fire of the mystic depths? And
now, the rain having partly extinguished the inner,
hidden flame, they come out to bask in the sun, and
drink deeply of the ambrosial air. They come, almost
slain with thirst, to the Mother Fountain. They
come out to worship at the shrine of the sweet-souled,
God-absorbed Rabia of Attar. In their bright, glowing
faces what a delectable message from the under
world of romance and enchantment! Their lips are
red with the kisses of love, in whose alembics, intangible,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
unseen, the dark and damp of the earth
are translated into warmth and colour and shade.
Ay, these dear little children, unfolding their soft
green scrolls and reading aloud such odes on Modesty
and Beauty, are as inspiring as the star-crowned night.
And every chink in my terrace walls seems to breathe
a message of sweetness and light and love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know you not the anecdote about the enchanting
Goddess Rabia, as related by Attar in his <i>Biographies
of Sufi Mystics and Saints</i>? Here it is. Rabia was
asked if she hated the devil, and she replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;
Asked again why, she said, &#8216;Being absorbed in love,
I have no time to hate.&#8217; Now, all the inhabitants of
my terraces and fields seem to echo this sublime sentiment
of their Goddess. The air and sunshine, nay,
the very rocks are imbued with it. See, how the
fissures in the boulders yonder seem to sympathise
with the gaps in the terrace walls: the cyclamen leaves
in the one are salaaming the cyclamen flowers in the
other. O, these terraces would have delighted the
heart of the American naturalist Thoreau. He could
not have desired stone walls with more gaps in them.
But mind you, these are not dark, ugly, hollow, hopeless
chinks. Behind every one of them lurks a mystery.
Far back in the niches I can see the busts of the
poets who wrote the poems which these beautiful wild
flowers are reading to me. Yes, the authors are dead,
and what I behold now are the flowers of their
amours. These are the offspring of their embraces,
the crystallised dew of their love. Yes, this one single,
simple act of love brings forth an infinite variety of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
flowers to celebrate the death of the finite outward
shape and the eternal essence of life perennial. In
complete surrender lies the divineness of things
eternal. This is the key-note of the Oriental mystic
poets. And I incline to the belief that they of all
bards have sung best the song of love. In rambling
through the fields with these beautiful children of the
terraces, I know not what draws me to Al-Fared, the
one erotic-mystic poet of Arabia, whose interminable
rhymes have a perennial charm. Perhaps such lines
as these,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>All that is fair is fairer when she rises,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>All that is sweet is sweeter when she is here;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>And every form of beauty she surprises</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>With one brief word she whispers in its ear:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>Thy wondrous charms, O let them not deceive thee;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>They are but borrowed from her for a while;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Thine outward guise and loveliness would grieve thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>If in thine inmost soul she did not smile.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>All colours, forms, into each other merging,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>Are woven on her Loom of Unity;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>For she alone is One in All diverging,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>And she alone is absolute and free.&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Now, I will bring you to a scene most curiously
suggestive. Behold that little knot of daisies pressing
around the alone anemone beneath the spreading
leaves of the colocasia. Here is a rout at the Countess
Casiacole&#8217;s, and these are the d&eacute;butantes crowding
around the Celebrity of the day. But would they do
so if they were sensible of their own worth, if they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
knew that their idol, flaunting the crimson crown of
popularity, had no more, and perhaps less, of the pure
essence of life than any of them? But let Celebrity
stand there and enjoy her hour; to-morrow the
Ploughman will come.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;The sage, with its spikes of greyish blue flowers,
its fibrous, velvety leaves, its strong, pungent perfume,
which is not squandered or repressed, is the stoic of
my native terraces. It responds generously to the personal
touch, and serves the Lebanonese, rich and poor
alike, with a little luxury. Ay, who of us, wandering
on foreign strands, does not remember the warm
foot-bath, perfumed with sage leaves, his mother used
to give him before going to bed? Our dear
mothers!&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;And here, Khalid goes in raptures and
tears about his sorry experience in Baalbek and the
anguish and sorrow of his poor mother. &#8220;But while
I stand,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;let me be like the sage, a live-oak
among shrubs, indifferent as the oak or pine to
the winds and storms. And as the sun is setting, find
you no solace in the thought, O Khalid, that some
angel herb-gatherer will preserve the perfume in your
leaves, to refresh therewith in other worlds your dear
poor mother?</p>
<p>&#8220;My native terraces are rich with faith and love,
luxuriant with the life divine and the wondrous symbols
thereof. And the grass here is not cut and
trimmed as in the artificial gardens and the cold dull
lawns of city folk, whose love for Nature is either
an experiment, a sport, a business, or a fad. &#8216;A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
dilettantism in Nature is barren and unworthy,&#8217; says
Emerson. But of all the lovers of Nature, the children
are the least dilettanteish. And every day here
I see a proof of this. Behold them wading to their
knees in that lusty grass, hunting the classic lotus
with which to deck their olive branches for the high
mass and ceremony of Palm Sunday. But alas, my
lusty grass and my beautiful wild flowers do not enjoy
the morning of Spring. Here, the ploughman
comes, carrying his long plough and goad on his
shoulder, and with him his wife lugging the yoke and
his boy leading the oxen. Alas, the sun shall not set on
these bright, glowing, green terraces, whose walls are
very ramparts of flowers. There, the boy with his
scythe is paving the way for his father&#8217;s plough; the
grass is mowed and given to the oxen as a bribe to
do the ugly business. And all for the sake of the ugly
mulberries, which are cultivated for the ugly silk-worms.
Come, let us to the heath, where the hiss of
the scythe and the &#8216;ho-back&#8217; and &#8216;oho&#8217; of the ploughman
are not heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;But let us swing from the road. Come, the
hedges of Nature are not as impassable as the hedges
of man. Through these scrub oaks and wild pears,
between this tangle of thickets, over the clematis and
blackberry bush,&ndash;&ndash;and here we are under the pines,
the lofty and majestic pines. How different are these
natural hedges, growing in wild disorder, from the
ugly cactus fences with which my neighbours choose to
shut in their homes, and even their souls. But my business
now is not with them. There are my friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
the children again gathering the pine-needles of last
summer for lighting the fire of the silk-worm nursery.
And down that narrow foot-path, meandering around
the boulders and disappearing among the thickets, see
what big loads of brushwood are moving towards us.
Beneath them my swarthy and hardy peasants are
plodding up the hill asweat and athirst. When I first
descended to the wadi, one such load of brushwood
emerging suddenly from behind a cliff surprised and
frightened me. But soon I was reminded of the moving
forest in Macbeth. The man bowed beneath the
load was hidden from view, and the boy directly behind
was sweating under a load as big as that of his
father. &#8216;<i>Awafy!</i>&#8217; (Allah give you strength), I said,
greeting them. &#8216;And increase of health to you,&#8217; they
replied. I then asked the boy how far down do
they have to go for their brushwood, and laying down
his load on a stone to rest, he points below, saying,
&#8216;Here, near the river.&#8217; But this &#8216;Here, near the
river&#8217; is more than four hours&#8217; walk from the village.&ndash;&ndash;Allah
preserve you in your strength, my
Brothers. And they pass along, plodding slowly under
their overshadowing burdens. A hard-hearted
Naturalist, who goes so deep into Nature as to be
far from the vital core even as the dilettante, might
not have any sympathy to throw away on such occasions.
But of what good is the love of Nature that
consists only in classification and dissection? I carry
no note-book with me when I go down the wadi or
out into the fields. I am content if I bring back a
few impressions of some reassuring instance of faith,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
a few pictures, and an armful of wild flowers and
odoriferous shrubs. Let the learned manual maker
concern himself with the facts; he is content with
jotting down in his note-book the names and lineage
of every insect and every herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Man? What is he to these scientific Naturalists?
If they meet a stranger on the road, they
pass him by, their eyes intent on the breviary of Nature,
somewhat after the fashion of my priests, who
are fond of praying in the open-air at sundown.
No, I do not have to prove to my Brothers that my
love of Nature is but second to my love of life. I
am interested in my fellow men as in my fellow trees
and flowers. &#8216;The beauty of Nature,&#8217; Emerson
again, &#8216;must always seem unreal and mocking until
the landscape has human figures, that are as good as
itself.&#8217; And &#8217;tis well, if they are but half as good.
To me, the discovery of a woodman in the wadi were
as pleasing as the discovery of a woodchuck or a woodswallow
or a woodbine. For in the soul of the woodman
is a song, I muse, as sweet as the rhythmic strains
of the goldfinch, if it could be evoked. But the soul
plodding up the hill under its heavy overshadowing
burden, what breath has it left for song? The man
bowed beneath the load, the soul bowed beneath the
man! Alas, I seem to behold but moving burdens
in my country. And yet, my swarthy and shrunken,
but firm-fibred people plod along, content, patient,
meek; and when they reach the summit of the hill
with their crushing burdens, they still have breath
enough to troll a favourite ditty or serenade the night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>I come to thee, O Night,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>I&#8217;m at thy feet;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>I can not see, O Night,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>But thy breath is sweet.&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;And so is the breath of the pines. Here, the air
is surcharged with perfume. In it floats the aromatic
soul of many a flower. But the perfume-soul
of the pines seems to tower over all others, just as
its material shape lifts its artistic head over the oak,
the cercis, and the terabinth. And though tall and
stately, my native pines are not forbidding. They are
so pruned that the snags serve as a most convenient
ladder. Such was my pleasure mounting for the
green cones, the salted pinons of which are delicious.
But I confess they seem to stick in the stomach as the
pitch of the cones sticks on the hands. This, however,
though it remains for days, works no evil; but
the pinons in the stomach, and the stomach on the
nerves,&ndash;&ndash;that is a different question.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only pines I have seen in the United States
are those in front of Emerson&#8217;s house in Concord;
but compared with my native trees, they are scrubby
and mean. These pine parasols under which I lay
me, forgiving and forgetting, are fit for the gods.
And although closely planted, they grow and flourish
without much ado. I have seen spots not exceeding
a few hundred square feet holding over thirty trees,
and withal stout and lusty and towering. Indeed,
the floor of the Tent seems too narrow at times for
its crowded guests; but beneath the surface there is
room for every root, and over it, the sky is broad
enough for all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the bewildering vistas through the variegated
pillars, taking in a strip of sea here, a mountain peak
there, have an air of enchantment from which no
human formula can release a pilgrim-soul. They remind
me&ndash;&ndash;no; they can not remind me of anything
more imposing. But when I was visiting the
great Mosques of Cairo I was reminded of them.
Yes, the pine forests are the great mosques of Nature.
And for art-lovers, what perennial beauty of an antique
art is here. These majestic pillars arched with
foliage, propping a light-green ceiling, from which
cones hang in pairs and in clusters, and through which
curiously shaped clouds can be seen moving in a cerulean
sky; and at night, instead of the clouds, the
stars&ndash;&ndash;the distant, twinkling, white and blue stars&ndash;&ndash;what
to these are the decorations in the ancient
mosques? There, the baroques, the arabesques, the
colourings gorgeous, are dead, at least inanimate; here,
they palpitate with life. The moving, swelling, flaming,
flowing life is mystically interwoven in the evergreen
ceiling and the stately colonnades. Ay, even
the horizon yonder, with its planets and constellations
rising and setting ever, is a part of the ceiling
decoration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in this grand Mosque of Nature, I read
my own Kor&acirc;n. I, Khalid, a Beduin in the desert
of life, a vagabond on the highway of thought, I come
to this glorious Mosque, the only place of worship
open to me, to heal my broken soul in the perfumed
atmosphere of its celestial vistas. The mihrabs here
are not in this direction nor in that. But whereso
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
one turns there are niches in which the living spirit of
Allah is ever present. Here, then, I prostrate me
and read a few Chapters of MY Holy Book. After
which I resign myself to my eternal Mother and the
soft western breezes lull me asleep. Yea, and even
like my poor brother Moslem sleeping on his hair-mat
in a dark corner of his airy Mosque, I dream my
dream of contentment and resignation and love.</p>
<p>&#8220;See the ploughman strutting home, his goad in his
hand, his plough on his shoulder, as if he had done
his duty. Allah be praised, the flowers in the terrace-walls
are secure. That is why, I believe, my
American brother Thoreau liked walls with many
gaps in them. The sweet wild daughters of Spring
can live therein their natural life without being
molested by the scythe or the plough. Allah be
praised a hundred times and one.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>SIGNS OF THE HERMIT</h3>
</div>
<p>Although we claim some knowledge of the
Lebanon mountains, having landed there in our
journey earthward, and having since then, our limbs
waxing firm and strong, made many a journey
through them, we could not, after developing, through
many readings, Khalid&#8217;s spiritual films, identify them
with the vicinage which he made his Kaaba. On
what hill, in what wadi, under what pines did he
ruminate and extravagate, we could not from these
idealised pictures ascertain. For a spiritual film is
other than a photographic one. A poet&#8217;s lens is
endowed with a seeing eye, an insight, and a faculty
to choose and compose. Hence the difficulty in tracing
the footsteps of Fancy&ndash;&ndash;in locating its cave, its
nest, or its Kaaba. His pine-mosque we could find
anywhere, at any altitude; his vineyards, too, and his
glades; for our mountain scenery, its beauty alternating
between the placid and the rugged&ndash;&ndash;the tame
terrace soil and the wild, forbidding majesty&ndash;&ndash;is allwhere
almost the same. But where in these rocky
and cavernous recesses of the world can we to-day
find the ancient Lebanon troglodyte, whom Khalid
has seen, and visited in his hut, and even talked with?
It is this that forces us to seek his diggings, to trace,
if possible, his footsteps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>In the K. L. MS., as we have once remarked and
more than once hinted, we find much that is unduly
inflated, truly Oriental; much that is platitudinous,
ludicrous, which we have suppressed. But never
could we question the Author&#8217;s veracity and sincerity
of purpose. Whether he crawled like a zo&ouml;phyte,
soared like an eagle, or fought, like Ali, the giants
of the lower world, he is genuine, and oft-times
amusingly truthful. But the many questionable pages
on this curious subject of the eremite, what are we
to do with them? If they are imaginary, there is too
much in this Book against quackery to daunt us.
And yet, if Khalid has found the troglodyte, whom
we thought to be an extinct species, he should have
left us a few legends about it.</p>
<p>We have visited the ancient caverns of the Lebanon
troglodytes in the cliffs overhanging the river
of Wadi Kadeesha, and found nothing there but
blind bats, and mosses, and dreary vacuity. No, not
a vestage of the fossil is there, not a skull, not a shinbone.
We have also inquired in the monasteries near
the Cedars, and we were frankly told that no monk
to-day fancies such a life. And if he did, he would
not give his brother monks the trouble of carrying
his daily bread to a cave in those forbidden cliffs.
And yet, Simeon Stylites, he of the Pillar, who remained
for thirty years perched on the top of it, was
a Syrian shepherd. But who of his descendants to-day
would as much as pass one night on the top of
that pillar? Curious eleemosynary phases of our
monkish system, these modern times reveal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>On our way from a journey to the Cedars, while
engaged in the present Work, we passed through a
pine forest, in which were some tangled bushes of the
clematis. The muleteer stops near one of these and
stoops to reach something he had seen therein. No
treasure-trove, alas, as he supposed; but merely a
book for which he lacerated his hands and which he
cursed and handed to us, saying, &#8220;This must be the
breviary of some monk.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it was an English book, and of American origin,
and of a kind quite rare in America. Indeed,
here were a find and surprise as agreeable as Khalid&#8217;s
sweetbrier bush. Henry Thoreau&#8217;s <i>Week</i>! What
a miracle of chance. Whose this mutilated copy of
the <i>Week</i>, we thought? Who in these mountains,
having been in America, took more interest in the
Dreamer of Walden Woods than in peddling and
trading? We walk our mule, looking about in vague,
restless surprise, as if seeking in the woods a lost companion,
and lo, we reach a monarch pine on which is
carved the name of&ndash;&ndash;Khalid! This book, then,
must be his; the name on the pine tree is surely his
own; we know his hand as well as his turn of mind.
But who can say if this be his Kaaba, this his pine-mosque?
Might he not only have passed through these
glades to other parts? Signs, indeed, are here of his
feet and hands, if not of his tent-pegs. And what
signifies his stay? No matter how long he might
have put up here, it is but a passage, deeply considered:
like Thoreau&#8217;s passage through Walden woods,
like Mohammad&#8217;s through the desert.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>This leisure hour is the nipple of the soul. And
fortunate they who are not artificially suckled, who
know this hour no matter how brief, who get their
nipple at the right time. If they do not, no pabulum
ever after, will their indurated tissues assimilate.
Do you wonder why the world is full of crusty souls?
and why to them this infant hour, this suckling while,
is so repugnant? But we must not intrude more of
such remarks about mankind. Whether rightly suckled
or not, we manage to live; but whether we do so
marmot-like or Maronite-like, is not the question here
to be considered. To pray for your bread or to burrow
in the earth for it, is it not the same with most
people? Given a missionary with a Bible in his hip-pocket
or a peasant with a load of brushwood on his
back and the same gastric coefficient, and you will
have in either case a resulting expansion for six feet
of coffin ground and a fraction of Allah&#8217;s mercy.
Our poor missionary, is it worth while to cross the
seas for this? Marmot-like or Maronite-like&ndash;&ndash;but
soft you know! Here is our peasant with his overshadowing
load of brushwood. And there is another,
and another. They are carrying fuel to the lime-pit
ahead of us yonder. What brow-sweat, what
time, what fire, what suffering and patient toil, the
lime-washing, or mere liming, of our houses and sepulchres,
requires. That cone structure there, that artificial
volcano, with its crackling, flaming bowels and
its fuliginous, coruscating crater, must our hardy
peasants feed continually for twenty days and nights.</p>
<p>But the book and the name on the pine, we would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
know more of these signs, if possible. And so, we
visit the labourers of the kiln. They are y&ouml;dling, the
while they work, and jesting and laughing. The
stokers, with flaming, swollen eyes, their tawny complexion
waxing a brilliant bronze, their sweat making
golden furrows therein, with their pikes and pitchforks
busy, are terribly magnificent to behold. Here
be men who would destroy Bastilles for you, if it
were nominated in the bond. And there is the monk-foreman&ndash;&ndash;the
kiln is of the monastery&#8217;s estate&ndash;&ndash;reading
his breviary while the lime is in making.
Indeed, these sodalities of the Lebanons are not what
their vows and ascetic theologies would make them.
No lean-jowled, hungry-looking devotees, living in
exiguity and droning in exinanition their prayers,&ndash;&ndash;not
by any means. Their flesh-pots are not a few,
and their table is a marvel of ascetism! And why
not, if their fat estates&ndash;&ndash;three-quarter of the lands
here is held in mortmain by the clergy&ndash;&ndash;can yield
anything, from silk cocoons to lime-pits? They will
clothe you in silk at least; they will lime-wash your
homes and sepulchres, if they cannot lime-wash anything
else. Thanks to them so long as they keep some
reminiscence of business in their heads to keep the
Devil out of it.</p>
<p>The monk-foreman is reading with one eye and
watching with the other. &#8220;Work,&#8221; cries he, &#8220;every
minute wasted is stolen from the abbey. And whoso
steals, look in the pit: its fire is nothing compared
with Juhannam.&#8221; And the argument serves its purpose.
The labourers hurry hither and thither, bringing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
brushwood near; the first stoker pitches to the
second, the second to the third, and he feeds the flaming,
smoking, coruscating volcano. &#8220;<i>Yallah!</i>&#8221;
(Keep it up) exclaims the monk-foreman. &#8220;Burn
the devil&#8217;s creed,&#8221; cries one. &#8220;Burn hell,&#8221; cries another.
And thus jesting in earnest, mightily working
and enduring, they burn the mountains into lime,
they make the very rocks yield somewhat.&ndash;&ndash;Strength
and blessings, brothers.</p>
<p>After the usual inquiry of whence and whither, his
monkship offers the snuff-box. &#8220;No? roll you, then,
a cigarette,&#8221; taking out a plush pouch containing a
mixture of the choicest native roots. These, we were
told, are grown on the monastery&#8217;s estate. We
speak of the cocoon products of the season.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beshrew the mulberries!&#8221; exclaims the monk.
&#8220;We are turning all our estates into fruit orchards
and orangeries. The cultivation of the silk-worm
is in itself an abomination. And while its income
to-day is not as much as it was ten years ago, the expenditure
has risen twofold. America is ruining our
agriculture; and soon, I suppose, we have to send to
China for labourers. Why, those who do not emigrate
demand twice as much to-day for half the work
they used to do five years ago; and those who return
from America strut about like country gentlemen deploring
the barrenness of their native soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>And one subject leading to another, for our monk
is a glib talker, we come to the cheese-makers, the
goatherds. &#8220;Even these honest rustics,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;are becoming sophisticated (<i>mafsudin</i>). Their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
cheese is no longer what it was, nor is their faith.
For Civilisation, passing by their huts in some shape
or other, whispers in their ears something about cleverness
and adulteration. And mistaking the one for
the other, they abstract the butter from the milk and
leave the verdigris in the utensils. This lust of gain
is one of the diseases which come from Europe and
America,&ndash;&ndash;it is a plague which even the goatherd
cannot escape. Why, do you know, wherever the
cheese-monger goes these days ptomaine poison is
certain to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why does not the Government interfere?&#8221;
we ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the Government,&#8221; replies our monk in
a dry, droll air and gesture, &#8220;does not eat cheese.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the monks, we learned, do not have to buy it.
For this, as well as their butter, olive oil, and wine,
is made on their own estates, under their own supervision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he resumes, placing his breviary in his
pocket and taking out the snuff-box; &#8220;not long ago
one who lived in these parts&ndash;&ndash;a young man from
Baalbek he was, and he had his booth in the pine forest
yonder&ndash;&ndash;bought some cheese from one of these muleteer
cheese-mongers, and after he had eaten of it fell
sick. It chanced that I was passing by on my way
to the abbey, when he was groaning and retching
beneath that pine tree. It was the first time I saw
that young man, and were I not passing by I know
not what would have become of him. I helped him
to the abbey, where he was ministered to by our physician,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
and he remained with us three days. He ate
of our cheese and drank of our wine, and seemed to
like both very much. And ever since, while he was
here, he would come to the abbey with a basket or a
tray of his own make&ndash;&ndash;he occupied himself in making
wicker-baskets and trays&ndash;&ndash;and ask in exchange
some of our cheese and olive oil. He was very intelligent,
this fellow; his eyes sometimes were like
the mouth of this pit, full of fire and smoke. But
he was queer. The clock in him was not wound
right&ndash;&ndash;he was always ahead or behind time, always
complaining that we monks did not reckon time as he
did. Nevertheless, I liked him much, and often
would I bring him some of our cookery. But he
never accepted anything without giving something in
exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unmistakable signs.</p>
<p>&#8220;And his black turban,&#8221; continues the monk,
&#8220;over his long flowing hair made him look like our
<ins class="trchange" title="Added closing double-quote">hermit.&#8221;</ins> (Strange coincidence!) &#8220;On your way here
have you not stopped to visit the hermit? Not far
from the abbey, on your right hand coming here, is
the Hermitage.&#8221;</p>
<p>We remember passing a pretty cottage surrounded
by a vineyard in that rocky wilderness; but who
would mistake that for a troglodyte&#8217;s cave? &#8220;And
this young man from Baalbek,&#8221; we ask, &#8220;how did
he live in this forest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yonder,&#8221; points the monk, &#8220;he cleared and
cleaned for himself a little space which he made his
workshop. And up in the pines he constructed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
platform, which he walled and covered with boughs.
And when he was not working or walking, he would
be there among the branches, either singing or asleep.
I used to envy him that nest in the pines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did he ever go to church?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He attended mass twice in our chapel, on Good
Friday and on Easter Sunday, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did he visit the abbey often?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when he wanted cheese or olive oil.&#8221;
(Shame, O Khalid!) &#8220;But he often repaired to
the Hermitage. I went with him once to listen to
his conversation with the Hermit. They often disagreed,
but never quarrelled. I like that young man
in spite of his oddities of thought, which savoured at
times of infidelity. But he is honest, believe me;
never tells a lie; and in a certain sense he is as pious
as our Hermit, I think. Roll another cigarette.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. And the Hermit, what is your
opinion of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, h&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;h&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;go visit him. A good man
he is, but very simple. And between us, he likes
money too much. H&#8217;m, h&#8217;m, go visit him. If I
were not engaged at present, I would accompany you
thither.&#8221;</p>
<p>We thank our good monk and retrace our steps
to the Hermitage, rolling meanwhile in our mind
that awful remark about the Hermit&#8217;s love of money.
Blindness and Plague! even the troglodyte loves and
worships thee, thou silver Demiurge! We can not believe
it. The grudges of monks against each other
often reach darker and more fatal depths. Alas, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
the faith of the cheese-monger is become adulterated,
what shall we say of the faith of our monkhood? If
the salt of the earth&ndash;&ndash;but not to the nunnery nor
to the monkery, we go. Rather let us to the Hermitage,
Reader, and with an honest heart; in earnest,
not in sport.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE VINEYARD IN THE KAABA</h3>
</div>
<p>This, then, is the cave of our troglodyte! Allah
be praised, even the hermits of the Lebanon
mountains, like the prophets of America and other
electric-age species, are subject to the laws of evolution.
A cottage and chapel set in a vineyard, the most
beautiful we have yet seen, looms up in this rocky
wilderness like an oasis in a desert. For many miles
around, the vicinage presents a volcanic aspect, wild,
barren, howlingly dreary. At the foot of Mt. Sanneen
in the east, beyond many ravines, are villages
and verdure; and from the last terrace in the vineyard
one overlooks the deep chasm which can boast
of a rivulet in winter. But in the summer its nakedness
is appalling. The sun turns its pocket inside
out, so to speak, exposing its boulders, its little <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'wind-rows' across lines">windrows</ins>
of sands, and its dry ditches full of dead fish
spawn. And the cold, rocky horizon, rising so high
and near, shuts out the sea and hides from the Hermit
the glory of the sundown. But we can behold
its effects on Mt. Sanneen, on the clouds above us,
on the glass casements in the villages far away. The
mountains in the east are mantled with etherial lilac
alternating with mauve; the clouds are touched with
purple and gold; the casements in the distance are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
scintillating with mystical carbuncles: the sun is setting
in the Mediterranean,&ndash;&ndash;he is waving his farewell
to the hills.</p>
<p>We reach the first gate of the Hermitage; and the
odour peculiar to monks and monkeries, a mixed
smell of mould and incense and burning oil, greets
us as we enter into a small open space in the centre
of which is a Persian lilac tree. To the right is a
barbed-wire fence shutting in the vineyard; directly
opposite is the door of the chapel; and near it is a
wicket before which stands a withered old woman.
Against the wall is a stone bench where another
woman is seated. As we enter, we hear her, standing
at the wicket, talking to some one behind the
scene. &#8220;Yes, that is the name of my husband,&#8221; says
she. &#8220;Allah have mercy on his soul,&#8221; sighs an exiguous
voice within; &#8220;pray for him, pray for him.&#8221;
And the woman, taking to weeping, blubbers out,
&#8220;Will thirty masses do, think your Reverence?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, that will cheer his soul,&#8221; replies the oracle.</p>
<p>The old woman thereupon enters the chapel, pays
the priest or serving-monk therein, one hundred piasters
for thirty masses, and goes away in tears. The
next woman rises to the gate. &#8220;I am the mother
of&ndash;&ndash;,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Ah, the mother of&ndash;&ndash;,&#8221; repeats
the exiguous voice. &#8220;How are you? (She must be
an old customer.) How is your husband? How are
your children? And those in America, are they well,
are they prosperous? Yes, yes, your deceased son.
Well, h&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;h&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;you must come again. I can not
tell you anything yet. Come again next week.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
And she, too, visits the chapel, counts out some money
to the serving-monk, and leaves the Hermitage, drying
her tears.</p>
<p>The Reader, who must have recognised the squeaking,
snuffling, exiguous voice, knows not perhaps that
the Hermit, in certain moments of <i>inkhitaf</i> (abstraction,
levitation) has glimpses into the spirit-world
and can tell while in this otherworldliness how the
Christian souls are faring, and how many masses
those in Purgatory need before they can rejoin the
bosom of Father Abraham. And those who seek
consolation and guidance through his occult ministrations
are mostly women. But the money collected
for masses, let it here be said, as well as the income
of the vineyard, the Hermit touches not. The
monks are the owners of the occult establishment,
and they know better than he what to do with the
revenue. But how far this ancient religious Medium
can go in the spirit-world, and how honest he might
be in his otherworldliness, let those say who have experience
in spookery and table-rapping.</p>
<p>Now, the women having done and gone, the wicket
is open, and the serving-monk ushers us through the
dark and stivy corridor to the rear, where a few
boxes marked &#8220;Made in America&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;petroleum
boxes, these&ndash;&ndash;are offered us as seats. Before the
door of the last cell are a few potsherds in which
sweet basil plants are withering from thirst. Presently,
the door squeaks, and one, not drooping like
the plants, comes out to greet us. This is Father
Abd&#8217;ul-Messiah (Servitor of the Christ), as the Hermit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
is called. Here, indeed, is an up-to-date hermit,
not an antique troglodyte. Lean and lathy, he is, but
not hungry-looking; quick of eye and gesture; quick
of step, too. He seems always on the alert, as if
surrounded continually with spirits. He is young,
withal, or keeps so, at least, through the grace and
ministration of Allah and the Virgin. His long unkempt
hair and beard are innocent of a single white
line. And his health? &#8220;Through my five and
twenty years of seclusion,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have not
known any disease, except, now and then, in the
spring season, when the sap begins to flow, I am
visited by Allah with chills and fever.&ndash;&ndash;No; I eat
but one meal a day.&ndash;&ndash;Yes; I am happy, Allah be
praised, quite happy, very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he lifts his eyes heavenward, and sighs and
rubs his hands in joyful satisfaction. To us, this
Servitor of the Christ seemed not to have passed the
climacteric. But truly, as he avowed, he was entering
the fifth lustrum beyond it. Such are the advantages
of the ascetic life, and of such ascetics the
Kingdom of Heaven. A man of sixty can carry
twenty years in his pocket, and seem all honesty, and
youth, and health, and happiness.</p>
<p>We then venture a question about the sack-cloth,
a trace of which was seen under his tunic sleeve.
And fetching a deep sigh, he gazes on the drooping
sweet basils in silence. No, he likes not to speak of
these mortifications of the flesh. After some meditation
he tells us, however, that the sack-cloth on the
first month is annoying, torturing. &#8220;But the flesh,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
he continues na&iuml;vely, &#8220;is inured to it, as the pile, in
the course of time, is broken and softened down.&#8221;
And with an honest look in his eyes, he smiled and
sighs his assurance. For his Reverence always punctuates
his speech with these sweet sighs of joy. The
serving-monk now comes to whisper a word in his
ear, and we are asked to &#8220;scent the air&#8221; a while in
the vineyard.</p>
<p>This lovely patch of terrace-ground the Hermit
tills and cultivates alone. And so thoroughly the
work is done that hardly a stone can be seen in the
soil. And so even and regular are the terrace walls
that one would think they were built with line and
plummet. The vines are handsomely trimmed and
trellised, and here and there, to break the monotony
of the rows, a fig, an apricot, an almond, or an olive,
spreads its umbrageous boughs. Indeed, it is most
cheering in the wilderness, most refreshing to the
senses, this lovely vineyard, the loveliest we have
seen.</p>
<p>Father Abd&#8217;ul-Messiah might be a descendant of
Simeon of the Pillar for all we know; but instead
of perching on the top of it, he breaks it down and
builds with its stones a wall of his vineyard. Here
he comes with his serving-monk, and we resume the
conversation under the almond tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should come in the grape season to taste of
my fruits,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you like the grape?&#8221; we ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I prefer to cultivate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout the season,&#8221; the serving-monk puts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
in, &#8220;and though the grapes be so plentiful, he tastes
them not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hermit is silent; for, as we have said, he is
reluctant in making such confessions. Virtue, once
bragged about, once you pride yourself upon it, ceases
to be such.</p>
<p>In his vineyard the Hermit is most thorough, even
scientific. One would think that he believed only in
work. No; he does not sprinkle the vines with holy
water to keep the grubs away. Herein he has sense
enough to know that only in <i>kabrit</i> (sulphur) is
the phylactery which destroys the phylloxera.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you do when you are not working
in your vineyard or praying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always somewhat to do, always. For
to be idle is to open the door for Iblis. I might
walk up and down this corridor, counting the slabs
therein, and consider my time well spent.&#8221; Saying
which he rises and points to the sky. The purple
fringes of the clouds are gone to sable; the lilac tints
on the mountains are waxing grey; and the sombre
twilight with his torch&ndash;&ndash;the evening star had risen&ndash;&ndash;is
following in the wake of day; &#8217;tis the hour of
prayer.</p>
<p>But before we leave him to his devotion, we ask
to be permitted to see his cell. Ah, that is against
the monastic rules. We insist. And with a h&#8217;m,
h&#8217;m, and a shake of the head, he rubs his hands caressingly
and opens the door. Yes, the Reader shall
peep into this eight by six cell, which is littered all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
around with rubbish, sacred and profane. In the corner
is a broken stove with a broken pipe attached,&ndash;&ndash;broken
to let some of the smoke into the room, we
are told. &#8220;For smoke,&#8221; quoth the Hermit, quoting
the Doctor, &#8220;destroys the microbes&ndash;&ndash;and keeps the
room warm after the fire goes out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the corner opposite the stove is a little altar
with the conventional icons and gewgaws and a number
of prayer books lying pell-mell around. Nearby
is an old pair of shoes, in which are stuck a few
candles and St. Anthony&#8217;s Book of Contemplations.
In the corner behind the door is a large cage, a pantry,
suspended middleway between the floor and ceiling,
containing a few earthen pots, an oil lamp, and
a jar, covered with a cloth. Between the pantry
and the altar, on a hair-mat spread on the floor,
sleeps his Reverence. And his bed is not so hard as
you might suppose, Reader; for, to serve your curiosity,
we have been rude enough to lift up a corner
of the cloth, and we found underneath a substantial
mattress! On the bed is his book of accounts, which,
being opened, when we entered, he hastened to close.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep accounts, too, Reverence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, so. That is a duty devolved on every
one with mortal memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let it not be supposed, however, that he has charge
of the crops. In his journal he keeps the accounts
of his masses? And here be evil sufficient for the
day.</p>
<p>This, then, is the inventory of Abd&#8217;ul-Messiah&#8217;s
cell. And we do not think we have omitted much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
of importance. Yes; in the fourth corner, which
we have not mentioned, are three or four petroleum
cans containing provisions. From one of these he
brings out a handful of dried figs, from another a
pinch of incense, which he gives us as a token of his
love and blessing. One thing we fain would emphasise,
before we conclude our account. The
money part of this eremitic business need not be
harshly judged; for we must bear in mind that this
honest Servitor of Christ is strong enough not to
have his will in the matter. And remember, too,
that the abbey&#8217;s bills of expenses run high. If one
of the monks, therefore, is blessed with a talent for
solitude and seclusion, his brother monks shall profit
by it. Indeed, we were told, that the income of the
Hermitage, that is, the sum total in gold of the occult
and the agricultural endeavours of Abd&#8217;ul-Messiah,
is enough to defray the yearly expenditures of
the monkery. Further, we have nothing to say on
the subject. But Khalid has. And of his lengthy
lucubration on <i>The Uses of Solitude</i>, we cull the
following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one&#8217;s life at certain times,&#8221; writes he, &#8220;is
either a Temple, a Hermitage, or a Vineyard: every
one, in order to flee the momentary afflictions of Destiny,
takes refuge either in God, or in Solitude, or in
Work. And of a truth, work is the balm of the sore
mind of the world. God and Solitude are luxuries
which only a few among us nowadays can afford. But
he who lives in the three, though his life be that of a
silk larva in its cocoon, is he not individually considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
a good man? Is he not a mystic, though uncreative,
centre of goodness? Surely, his influence, his Me
alone considered, is living and benign, and though it
is not life-giving. He is a flickering taper under
a bushel; and this, <i>billah</i>, were better than the
pissasphaltum-souls which bushels of quackery and pretence
can not hide. But alas, that a good man by
nature should be so weak as to surrender himself entirely
to a lot of bad men. For the monks, my brother
Hermit, being a silk worm in its cocoon, will asphyxiate
the larva after its work is done, and utilise the silk.
Ay, after the Larva dies, they pickle and preserve it in
their chapel for the benefit of those who sought its
oracles in life. Let the beef-packers of America take
notice; the monks of my country are in the market
with &#8216;canned hermits!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this Larva, be it remembered, is not subject
to decay; a saint does not decompose in the flesh like
mortal sinners. One of these, I have been told, dead
fifty years ago and now canonised, can be seen yet in
one of the monasteries of North Lebanon, keeping well
his flesh and bones together&ndash;&ndash;divinely embalmed. It
has been truly said that the work of a good man never
dies; and these leathery hermits continue in death as in
life to counsel and console the Faithful.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, these Larv&aelig;, not being cultivated for
the market, continued their natural course of development
and issued out of their silk prisons full fledged
moths. But those who cultivate them to-day are in
sore need. They have masses and indulgences to sell;
they have big bills to pay. But whether left to grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
their wings or not, their solitude is that of a cocoon
larva, narrow, stale, unprofitable to the world. While
that of a philosopher, a Thoreau, for instance, might
be called Nature&#8217;s filter; and one, issuing therefrom
benefited in every sense, morally, physically, spiritually,
can be said to have been filtered through Solitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The study of life at a distance is inutile; the study
of it at close range is defective. The only method
left, therefore, and perhaps the true one, is that of
the artist at his canvas. He works at his picture an
hour or two, and retires a little to study and criticise
it from a distance. It is impossible to withdraw
entirely from life and pretend to take an interest
in it. Either like my brother Hermit in these parts,
a spiritual larva in its cocoon, or like a Thoreau,
who during his period of seclusion, peeped every fortnight
into the village to keep up at least his practice
of human speech. Else what is the use of solitude?
A life of fantasy, I muse, is nearer to the
heart of Nature and Truth than a life in sack-cloth
and ashes....</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, deeply considered, this eremitic business
presents another aspect. For does not the eremite
through his art of prayer and devotion, seek an ideal?
Is he not a transcendentalist, at least in the German
sense of the word? Is not his philosophy above all
the senses, as the term implies, and common sense included?
For through Mother Church, and with
closed eyes, he will attain the ideal, of which my
German philosopher, through the logic-mill, and with
eyes open, hardly gets a glimpse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The devout and poetic souls, and though they
walk among the crowd, live most of their lives in
solitude. Through Mother Sorrow, or Mother
Fancy, or Mother Church, they are ever seeking the
ideal, which to them is otherwise unattainable. And
whether a howler of Turabu or a member of the
French Academy, man, in this penumbra of faith
and doubt, of superstition and imagination, is much
the same. &#8216;The higher powers in us,&#8217; says Novalis,
&#8216;which one day, as Genii, shall fulfil our will,
are for the present, Muses, which refresh us on our
toilsome course with sweet remembrances.&#8217; And the
jinn, the fairies, the angels, the muses, are as young
and vivacious to-day as they were in the Arabian
and Gaelic Ages of Romance.</p>
<p>&#8220;But whether Mother Church or Poetry or Philosophy
or Music be the magic-medium, the result
is much the same if the motive be not religiously
sincere, sincerely religious, piously pure, lofty, and
humane. Ay, my Larva-Hermit, with all his bigotry
and straitness of soul, stands higher than most of
your artists and poets and musicians of the present
day. For a life sincerely spent between the Temple
and the Vineyard, between devotion and honest
labour, producing to one man of all mankind some
positive good, is not to be compared with the life
which oscillates continuously between egoism and
vanity, quackery and cowardice, selfishness and pretence,
and which never rises, do what it may, above
the larva state....</p>
<p>&#8220;Let every one cultivate with pious sincerity some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
such vineyard as my Hermit&#8217;s and the world will
not further need reform. For through all the vapour
and mist of his ascetic theology, through the tortuous
chasm of his eremitic logic, through the bigotry
and crass superstition of his soul, I can always
see the Vineyard on the one side of his cell, and the
Church on the other, and say to myself: Here be
a man who is never idle; here be one who loves the
leisure praised by Socrates, and hates the sluggishness
which Iblis decks and titivates. And if he
crawls between his Church and his Vineyard, and
burrows in both for a solution of life, nay, spins in
both the cocoon of his ideal, he ought not to be judged
from on high. Come thou near him; descend; descend
a little and see: has he not a task, and though
it be of the taper-under-the-bushel kind? Has he not
a faith and a sincerity which in a Worm of the
Earth ought to be reckoned sublime? &#8216;If there were
sorrow in heaven,&#8217; he once said to me, &#8216;how many
there would continuously lament the time they wasted
in this world?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;O my Brothers, build your Temples and have
your Vineyards, even though it be in the rocky wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE DISENTANGLEMENT OF THE ME</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Why this exaggerated sense of thine importance,&#8221;
Khalid asks himself in the K. L. MS., &#8220;when
a little ptomaine in thy cheese can poison the source
of thy lofty contemplations? Why this inflated conception
of thy Me, when an infusion of poppy seeds
might lull it to sleep, even to stupefaction? What
avails thy logic when a little of the Mandragora can
melt the material universe into golden, unfolding infinities
of dreams? Why take thyself so seriously
when a leaf of henbane, taken by mistake in thy salad,
can destroy thee? But the soul is not dependent on
health or disease. The soul is the source of both
health and disease. And life, therefore, is either a
healthy or a diseased state of the soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, when I was rolling these questions in my
mind, and working on a reed basket to present to my
friend the Hermit as a farewell memento, his serving-monk
brings me some dried figs in a blue kerchief and
says, &#8216;My Master greets thee and prays thee come to
him.&#8217; I do so the following morning, bringing with
me the finished basket, and as I enter the Hermitage
court, I find him repairing a stone wall in the vineyard.
As he sees me, he hastens to put on his cloak that I
might not remark the sack-cloth he wore, and with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
pious smile of assurance and thankfulness, welcomes
and embraces me, as is his wont. We sit down in the
corridor before the chapel door. The odorous vapor
of what was still burning in the censer within hung
above us. The holy atmosphere mantled the dread
silence of the place. And the slow, insinuating smell
of incense, like the fumes of gunga, weighed heavy on
my eyelids and seemed to brush from my memory the
cobwebs of time. A drowsiness possessed me; I felt
like one awaking from a dream. I asked for the water
jug, which the Hermit hastened to bring. And looking
through the door of the chapel, I saw on the altar a
burning cresset flickering like the planet Mercury on
a December morning. How often did I light such a
cresset when a boy, I mused. Yes, I was an acolyte
once. I swang the censer and drank deep of the incense
fumes as I chanted in Syriac the service. And I
remember when I made a mistake one day in reading
the Epistle of Paul, the priest, who was of an irascible
humour, took me by the ear and made me spell the
words I could not pronounce. And the boys in the congregation
tittered gleefully. In my mortification was
honey for them. Such was my pride, nevertheless,
such the joy I felt, when, of all the boys that gathered
round the lectern at vespers, I was called upon to read
in the <i>sinksar</i> (hagiography) the Life of the Saint of
the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew then that to steal, for instance, is a sin;
and yet, I emptied the box of wafers every morning
after mass and shared them with the very boys who
laughed at my mistakes. One day, in the purest intention,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
I offered one of these wafers to my donkey and
he would not eat it. I felt insulted, and never after
did I pilfer a wafer. Now, as I muse on these sallies
of boyish waywardness I am impressed with the idea
that the certainty and daring of Ignorance, or might I
say Innocence, are great. Indeed, to the pure everything
is pure. But strange to relate that as I sat in
the corridor of the Hermitage and saw the light flickering
on the altar, I hankered for a wafer, and was
tempted to go into the chapel and filch one. What
prevented me? Alas, knowledge makes sceptics and
cowards of us all. And the pursuit of knowledge, according
to my Hermit, nay, the noblest pursuit, even
the serving of God, ceases to be a virtue the moment
we begin to enjoy it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is necessary to conquer, not only our instincts,&#8217;
he continued, &#8216;but our intellectual and our
spiritual passions as well. To force our will in the
obedience of a higher will, to leave behind all our
mundane desires in the pursuit of the one great desire,
herein lies the essence of true virtue. St. Anthony
would snatch his hours of devotion from the Devil.
Even prayer to him was a struggle, an effort not to
feel the joy of it. Yes, we must always disobey our
impulses, and resist the tyranny of our desires. When
I have a strong desire to pray, I go out into the vineyard
and work. When I begin to enjoy my work in
the vineyard, I cease to do it well. Therefore, I take
up my breviary. Do that which you must not do,
when you are suffering, and you will not want to do
it again, when you are happy. The other day, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
who visited the Hermitage, spoke to me of you, O
Khalid. He said you were what is called an anarchist.
And after explaining to me what is meant by this&ndash;&ndash;I
never heard of such a religion before&ndash;&ndash;I discovered
to my surprise that I, too, am an anarchist. But there
is this difference between us: I obey only God and
the authority of God, and you obey your instincts and
what is called the authority of reason. Yours, O Khalid,
is a narrow conception of anarchy. In truth, you
should try to be an anarchist like me: subordinate your
personality, your will and mind and soul, to a higher
will and intelligence, and resist with all your power
everything else. Why do you not come to the Hermitage
for a few days and make me your confessor?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I do not confess in private, and I can not sleep
within doors.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You do not have to do so; the booth under the almond
tree is at your disposal. Come for a spiritual
exercise of one week only.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have been going through such an exercise for a
year, and soon I shall leave my cloister in the pines.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What say you? You are leaving our neighbourhood?
No, no; remain here, O Khalid. Come, live
with me in the Hermitage. Come back to Mother
Church; return not to the wicked world. O Khalid,
we must inherit the Kingdom of Allah, and we can not
do so by being anarchist like the prowlers of the forest.
Meditate on the insignificance and evanescence
of human life.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But it lies within us, O my Brother, to make it
significant and eternal.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, truly, in the bosom of Mother Church.
Come back to your Mother&ndash;&ndash;come to the Hermitage&ndash;&ndash;let
us pass this life together.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And what will you do, if in the end you discover
that I am in the right?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he paused a moment, and, casting on me a
benignant glance, makes this reply: &#8216;Then, I will
rejoice, rejoice,&#8217; he gasped; &#8216;for we shall both be in the
right. You will become an anarchist like me and not
against the wretched authorities of the world, but
against your real enemies, Instinct and Reason.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thus, now and then, he would salt his argument
with a pinch of casuistic wit. Once he was hard
set, and, to escape the alternatives of the situation, he
condescended to tell me the story of his first and only
love.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In my youth,&#8217; said the Hermit, &#8216;I was a shoemaker,
and not a little fastidious as a craftsman. In
fact, I am, and always have been, an extremist, a purist.
I can not tolerate the cobblings of life. Either
do your work skilfully, devotedly, earnestly, or do it
not. So, as a shoemaker, I succeeded very well.
Truth to tell, my work was as good, as neat, as elegant
as that of the best craftsman in Beirut. And you
know, Beirut is noted for its shoemakers. Yes, I was
successful as any of them, and I counted among my
customers the bishop of the diocese himself. One day,
forgive me, Allah! a young girl, the daughter of a
peasant neighbour, comes into the shop to order a pair
of shoes. In taking the measure of her foot&ndash;&ndash;but I
must not linger on these details. A shoemaker can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
not fail to notice the shape of his customer&#8217;s foot.
Well, I measured, too, her ankle&ndash;&ndash;ah, forgive me,
Allah!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In brief, when the shoes were finished&ndash;&ndash;I spent
a whole day in the finishing touches&ndash;&ndash;I made her a
present of them. And she, in recognition of my favor,
made a plush tobacco bag, on which my name was
worked in gold threads, and sent it to me, wrapped in
a silk handkerchief, with her brother. Now, that is
the opening chapter. I will abruptly come to the last,
skipping the intermediate parts, for they are too silly,
all of them. I will only say that I was as earnest, as
sincere, as devoted in this affair of love as I was in
my craft. Of a truth, I was mad about both.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now the closing chapter. One day I went to see
her&ndash;&ndash;we were engaged&ndash;&ndash;and found she had gone to
the spring for water. I follow her there and find her
talking to a young man, a shoemaker like myself. No,
he was but a cobbler. On the following day, going
again to see her, I find this cobbler there. I remonstrate
with her, but in vain. And what is worse, she
had sent to him the shoes I made, to be repaired. He
was patching my own work! I swallowed my ire and
went back to my shop. A week later, to be brief, I
went there again, and what I beheld made my body
shiver. She, the wench. Forgive me, Allah! had her
hands around his neck and her lips&ndash;&ndash;yes, her lying
lips, on his cheek! No, no; even then I did not utter
a word. I could but cry in the depth of my heart.
How can woman be so faithless, so treacherous&ndash;&ndash;in
my heart I cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It was a terrible shock; and from it I lay in bed
for days with chills and fever. Now, when I recovered,
I was determined on pursuing a new course of
life. No longer would I measure women&#8217;s feet. I
sold my stock, closed my shop, and entered the monastery.
I heard afterwards that she married that young
cobbler; emigrated with him to America; deserted him
there; returned to her native village; married again,
and fled with her second husband to South Africa.
Allah be praised! even He appreciates the difference
between a shoemaker and a cobbler; and the bad woman
He gives to the bad craftsman. That is why I say,
Never be a cobbler, whatever you do.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But in the monastery&ndash;&ndash;draw near, I will speak
freely&ndash;&ndash;in the monastery, too, there are cobblers and
shoemakers. There, too, is much ungodliness, much
treachery, much cobbling. Ah me, I must not speak
thus. Forgive me, Allah! But I promised to tell
you the whole story. Therefore, I will speak freely.
After passing some years in the monastery, years of
probation and grief they were, I fell sick with a virulent
fever. The abbot, seeing that there was little
chance of my recovery, would not send for the physician.
And so, I languished for weeks, suffering from
thirst and burning pains and hunger. I raved and
chattered in my delirium. I betrayed myself, too,
they told me. The monks my brothers, even during
my suffering, made a scandal of the love affair I related.
They said that I exposed my wounds and my
broken heart before the Virgin, that I sinned in thought
and word on my death-bed. Allah forgive them. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
may be, however; for I know not what I said and what
I did. But when I recovered, I was determined not to
remain in the monastery, and not to return to the
world. The wicked world, I disentangled myself absolutely
from its poisoned meshes. I came to the Hermitage,
to this place. And never, since I made my
second remove until now, have I known disease, or
sorrow, nor treachery, which is worse than both. Allah
be praised! One&#8217;s people, one&#8217;s brothers, one&#8217;s
lovers and friends, are a hindrance and botheration.
We are nothing, nothing: God is everything. God is
the only reality. And in God alone is my refuge.
That is my story in brief. If I did not like you, I
would not have told it, and so freely. Meditate upon
it, and on the insignificance and evanescence of human
life. The world is a snare, and a bad snare, at that.
For it can not hold us long enough in it to learn to
like it. It is a cobbler&#8217;s snare. The world is full of
cobblers, O Khalid. Come away from it; be an ideal
craftsman&ndash;&ndash;be an extremist&ndash;&ndash;be a purist&ndash;&ndash;come
live with me. Let us join our souls in devotion, and
our hearts in love. Come, let us till and cultivate
this vineyard together.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And taking me by the hand, he shows me a cell
furnished with a hair-mat, a <i>masnad</i> (leaning pillow),
and a chair. &#8216;This cell,&#8217; says he, &#8216;was occupied by
the Bishop when he came here for a spiritual exercise
of three weeks. It shall be yours if you come; it&#8217;s the
best cell in the Hermitage. Now, let us visit the
chapel.&#8217; I go in with him, and as we are coming out,
I ask him child-like for a wafer. He brings the box
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
straightway, begs me to take as much as I desire, and
placing his hand on my shoulder, encircles me with
one of his benignant glances, saying, &#8216;Allah illumine
thy heart, O Khalid.&#8217; &#8216;Allah hear thy prayer,&#8217; I reply.
And we part in tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Khalid bursts in ecstasy about the higher spiritual
kingdom, and chops a little logic about the I and
the not-I, the Reality and the non-Reality.&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;God,&#8221;
says the Hermit. &#8220;Thought,&#8221; says the
Idealist, &#8220;that is the only Reality.&#8221; And what is
Thought, and what is God, and what is Matter, and
what is Spirit? They are the mysterious vessels of
Life, which are always being filled by Love and emptied
by Logic. &#8220;The external world,&#8221; says the Materialist&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Does
not exist,&#8221; says the Idealist. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
immaterial if it does or not,&#8221; says the Hermit. And
what if the three are wrong? The Universe, knowable
and unknowable, will it be affected a whit by it?
If the German Professor&#8217;s Chair of Logic and Philosophy
were set up in the Hermitage, would anything be
gained or lost? Let the <i>I</i> deny the stars, and they
will nevertheless roll in silence above it. Let the not-I
crush this I, this &#8220;thinking reed,&#8221; and the higher universal
I, rising above the stars and flooding the sidereal
heavens with light, will warm, remold, and regenerate
the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can conceive of a power,&#8221; writes Khalid in that
vexing Manuscript, &#8220;which can create a beautiful
parti-colored sun-flower of the shattered fragments of
Idealism, Materialism, and my Hermit&#8217;s theology.
Why not, if in the New World&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; And here, of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
sudden, to surprise and bewilder us, he drags in Mrs.
Eddy and the Prophet Dowie yoked under the yoke of
Whitman. He marks the <i>Key to Scripture</i> with blades
from <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and such fuel as he gathers from
both, he lights with an ember borrowed from the chariot
to Elijah. And thus, for ten whole pages, beating
continually, now in the dark of Metaphysics, now in
the dusk of Science; losing himself in the tangled
bushes of English Materialism, and German Mysticism,
and Arabic Sufism; calling now to Berkeley, now
to Hackel; meeting with Spencer here, with Al-Gazzaly
there; and endeavoring to extricate himself in the
end with some such efforts as &#8220;the Natural being
Negativity, the Spiritual must be the opposite of that,
and both united in God form the Absolute,&#8221; etc., etc.
But we shall not give ourselves further pain in laying
before the English reader the like heavy and unwieldy
lumber. Whoever relishes such stuff, and can
digest it, need not apply to Khalid; for, in this case,
he is but a poor third-hand caterer. Better go to the
Manufacturers direct; they are within reach of every
one in this Age of Machinery and Popular Editions.
But there are passages here, of which Khalid can say,
&#8216;The Mortar at least is mine.&#8217; And in this Mortar
he mixes and titrates with his Neighbour&#8217;s Pestle some
of his fantasy and insight. Of these we offer a sample:</p>
<p>&#8220;I say with psychologists, as the organism, so is the
personality. The revelation of the Me is perfect in
proportion to the sound state of the Medium. But
according to the Arabic proverb, the jar oozes of its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
contents. If these be of a putridinous mixture, therefore,
no matter how sound the jar, the ooze is not going
to smell of ambergris and musk. So, it all depends
on the contents with which the Potter fills his
jugs and pipkins, I assure you. And if the contents
are good and the jar is sound, we get such excellence
of soul as is rare among mortals. If the contents are
excellent and the jar is cracked, the objective influence
will then predominate, and putrescence, soon or
late, will set in. Now, the Me in the majority of
mankind comes to this world in a cracked pipkin, and
it oozes out entirely as soon as it liquifies in youth.
The pipkin, therefore, goes through life empty and
cracked, ever sounding flat and false. While in
others the Me is enclosed in a sealed straw-covered
flask and can only be awakened by either evaporation
or decapitation, in other words, by a spiritual revolution.
And in the very few among mortals, it emerges
out of the iron calyx of a flower of red-hot steel, or
flows from the transparent, odoriferous bosom of a
rose of light. In the first we have a C&aelig;sar, an Alexander,
a Napoleon; in the second, a Buddha, a Socrates,
a Christ.</p>
<p>&#8220;But consider that Science, in the course of psychological
analysis, speaks of Christ, Napoleon, and
Shakespeare, as patients. Such exalted states of the
soul, such activity of the mind, such exuberance of
spiritual strength, are but the results of the transformation
of the Me in the subject, we are told, and
this transformation has its roots in the organism.
But why, I ask, should there be such a gulf between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
individuals, such a difference in their Mes, when a difference
in the organism is a trifle in comparison?
How account for the ebb and flow in the souls, or let
us say, in the expression of the individualities, of Mohammad
the Prophet, for instance, and Mohammad
the camel-herd? And why is it in psychological
states that are similar, the consciousness of the one is
like a mountain peak, so to speak, and that of the
other like a cave?</p>
<p>&#8220;A soldier is severely wounded in battle and a
change takes place in his nervous organism, by reason
of which he loses his organic consciousness; or, to speak
in the phraseology of the psychologist, he loses the
sense of his own body, of his physical personality.
The cause of this change is probably the wound received;
but the nature of the change can be explained
only by hypotheses, which are become matters of
choice and taste&ndash;&ndash;and sometimes of personal interest
among scientists. Now, when the question is resolved
by hypothesis, is not even a layman free to
offer one? If I say the Glass is shattered and the
Me within is sadly reflected, or in a more tragic instance
the light of the Me runs out, would I not be
offering thee a solution as dear and tenable as that
of the professor of psychology?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE OF THE DAWN</h3>
</div>
<p>Breathless but scathless, we emerge from
the mazes of metaphysics and psychology where
man and the soul are ever playing hide-and-seek; and
where Khalid was pleased to display a little of his
killing skill in fencing. To those mazes, we promise
the Reader, we shall not return again. In our present
sojourn, however, it is necessary to go through the
swamps and Jordans as well as the mountains and
plains. Otherwise, we would not have lingered a
breathing while in the lowlands of mystery. But now
we know how far Khalid went in seeking health, and
how deep in seeking the Me, which he would disentangle
from the meshes of philosophy and anchoretism,
and bring back to life, triumphant, loving, joyous,
free. And how far he succeeded in this, we shall soon
know.</p>
<p>On the morning of his last day in the pines, meanwhile,
we behold him in the chariot of Apollo serenading
the stars. He no longer would thrust a poker
down his windpipe; for he breathes as freely as the
mountain bears and chirps as joyously as the swallows.
And his lungs? The lungs of the pines are not as
sound. And his eyes? Well, he can gaze at the rising
sun without adverting the head or squinting or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
shedding a tear. Now, as a sign of this healthy state
of body and mind, and his healthier resolve to return
to the world, to live opposite his friend the Hermit
on the other antipode of life, and furthermore, as a
relief from the exhausting tortuosities of thought in
the last Chapter, we give here a piece of description
notably symbolical.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;I slept very early last night; the lights in the
chapel of the abbey were still flickering, and the
monks were chanting the complines. The mellow
music of a drizzle seemed to respond sombrely to the
melancholy echo of the choir. About midnight the
rain beat heavily on the pine roof of the forest, and
the thunder must have struck very near, between me
and the monks. But rising very early this morning
to commune for the last time with the pensive silence
of dawn in the pines, I am greeted, as I peep out of
my booth, by a knot of ogling stars. But where is
the opaque breath of the storm, where are the clouds?
None seem to hang on the horizon, and the sky is as
limpid and clear as the dawn of a new life. Glorious,
this interval between night and dawn. Delicious, the
flavour of the forest after a storm. Intoxicating, the
odours of the earth, refreshed and satisfied. Divine,
the whispers of the morning air, divine!</p>
<p>&#8220;But where is the rain, and where are the thunderbolts
of last night? The forest and the atmosphere
retain but the sweet and scented memories of their
storming passion. Such a December morning in these
mountain heights is a marvel of enduring freshness and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
ardour. All round one gets a vivid illusion of Spring.
The soft breezes caressing the pines shake from their
boughs the only evidence of last night&#8217;s storm. And
these are more like the dew of Summer than the lees
of the copious tears of parting Autumn. A glorious
morning, too glorious to be enjoyed by a solitary soul.
But near the rivulet yonder stands a fox sniffing the
morning air. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my
coffee, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gather my mulberry sticks, kindle them with a
handful of dried pine needles, roast my coffee beans,
and grind them while the water boils in the pot. In
half an hour I am qualified to go about my business.
The cups and coffee utensils I wash and restore to
the chest&ndash;&ndash;and what else have I to do to-day? Pack
up? Allah be praised, I have little packing to do.
I would pack up, if I could, a ton of the pine air and
the forest perfume, a strip of this limpid sky, and a
cluster of those stars. Never at such an hour and
in this season of the year did I enjoy such transporting
limpidity in the atmosphere and such reassuring
expansiveness on the horizon. Why, even the stars,
the constellations, and the planets, are all here to enjoy
this with me. Not one of them, I think, is
absent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mountains are lost in the heavens. They are
seeking, as it were, the sisters of the little flowers
sleeping at their feet. The moon, resembling a
crushed orange, is sinking in the Mediterranean.
The outlines of earth and sky all round are vague, indistinct.
Were not the sky so clear and the atmosphere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
so rare, thus affording the planets and the constellations
to shed their modicum of light, the dusk of
this hour would have deprived the scene of much of
its pensive beauty of colour and shade. But there is
Pegasus, Andromeda, Aldebaran, not to mention
Venus and Jupiter and Saturn,&ndash;&ndash;these alone can conquer
the right wing of darkness. And there is Mercury,
like a lighted cresset shaken by the winds,
flapping his violet wings above the Northeastern horizon;
and Mars, like a piece of gold held out by
the trembling hand of a miser, is sinking in the blue
of the sea with Neptune; the Pleiades are stepping
on the trail of the blushing moon; the Balance lingers
behind to weigh the destinies of the heroes who are
to contend with the dawn; while Venus, peeping from
her tower over Mt. Sanneen, is sending love vibrations
to all. I would tell thee more if I knew. But
I swear to thee I never read through the hornbook of
the heavens. But if I can not name and locate more
of the stars, I can tell thee this about them <ins class="trchange" title="Original may be ';'">all:</ins> they
are the embers of certainty eternally glowing in the
ashes of doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Eastern horizon is yet lost in the dusk; the
false dawn is spreading the figments of its illusion;
the trees in the distance seem like rain-clouds; and
the amorphous shadows of the monasteries on the
mountain heights and hilltops all around, have not
yet developed into silhouettes. Everything, except
the river in the wadi below, is yet asleep. Not even
the swallows are astir. Ah, but my neighbour yonder
is; the light in the loophole of his hut sends a struggling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
ray through the mulberries, and the tintinnabulations
of his daughter&#8217;s loom are like so many stones
thrown into this sleeping pond of silence. The loom-girl
in these parts is never too early at her harness
and shuttle. I know a family here whose loom and
spinning wheel are never idle: the wife works at the
loom in the day and her boy at the wheel; while in
the night, her husband and his old mother keep up
the game. And this hardly secures for them their
flour and lentils the year round. But I concern not
myself now with questions of economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, another of my neighbours is awake; and
the hinges of his door, shrieking terribly, fiendishly,
startle the swallows from their sleep. And here are
the muleteers, yodling, as they pass by, their</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>Dhome, Dhome, Dhome,<br />

<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Hide me, hide me quickly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>And say I am not home.&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Lo, the horizon is disentangling itself from the
meshes of darkness. The dust of haze and dusk on
the scalloped edges of the mountains, is blown away
by the first breath of dawn. The lighter grey of the
horizon is mirrored in the clearer blue of the sea.
But the darkness seems to gather on the breast of the
sloping hills. Conquered on the heights, it retreats
into the wadi. Ay, the darkest hour is nearest the
dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the light grey is become a lavender; the outlines
of earth and sky are become more distinct;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the mountain peaks, the dusky veil being rent, are
separating themselves from the heaven&#8217;s embrace; the
trees in the distance no longer seem like rain-clouds;
and the silhouettes of the monasteries are casting off
the cloak of night. The lavender is melting now into
heliotrope, and the heliotrope is bursting here and
there in pink; the stars are waning, the constellations
are dying out, and the planets are following in their
wake. The darkness, too, which has not yet retreated
from the wadi, must soon follow; for the front guard
of the dawn is near. Behold the shimmer of their
steel! And see, in the dust of the retreating darkness,
the ochre veins of the lime cliffs are now perceptible.
And that huge pillar, which looked like
the standard-bearer of Night, is transformed into a
belfry; and a monk can be seen peeping through the
ogive beneath it. Mt. Sanneen, its black and ochre
scales thrown in relief on a coat of grey, is like a
huge panther sleeping over the many-throated ravine
of Kisrawan. Ah, the pink flower of dawn is bursting
in golden glory, thrilling in orange and saffron,
flaming with the ardency of love and hope. The
dawn! The glow and glamour of the Eastern
dawn!...</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;The dawn of a new life, of a better, purer,
healthier, higher spiritual kingdom. I would have its
temples and those of the vast empire of wealth and
material well-being, stand side by side. Ay, I would
even rear an altar to the Soul in the temple of Materialism,
and an altar to Materialism in the temple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
of the Soul. Each shall have its due, each shall glory
in the sacred purity and strength of life; each shall
develop and expand, but never at the expense of the
other. I will have neither the renunciation which
ends in a kind of idiocy dignified with a philosophic
or a theologic name, nor the worldliness which ends
in bestiality. I am a citizen of two worlds&ndash;&ndash;a citizen
of the Universe; I owe allegiance to two kingdoms.
In my heart are those stars and that sun, and
the LIGHT of those stars and that sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am equally devoted both to the material
and the spiritual. And when the two in me are opposed
to each other, conflicting, inimical, obdurate,
my attitude towards them is neither that of my friend
the Hermit nor that of my European superman. I
sit down, shut my eyes, compose myself, and concentrate
my mind on the mobility of things. If the
clouds are moving, why, I have but to sit down and
let them move away. I let my No-will, in this
case, dominate my will, and that serves my purpose
well. To be sure, every question tormenting us
would resolve itself favourably, or at least indifferently,
if we did not always rush in, wildly,
madly, and arrogate to ourselves such claims of authority
and knowledge as would make Olympus
shake with laughter. The resignation and passiveness
of the spirit should always alternate equitably
with the terrible strivings of the will. For the dervish
who whirls himself into a foaming ecstasy of devotion
and the strenuous American who works himself
up to a sweating ecstasy of gain, are the two poles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
of the same absurdity, the two ends of one evil. Indeed,
to my way of thinking, the man on the Stock
Exchange and the demagogue on the stump, for instance,
are brothers to the blatant corybant.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_III_THE_SELF_ECSTATIC' id='CHAPTER_III_THE_SELF_ECSTATIC'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE SELF ECSTATIC</h3>
</div>
<p>To graft the strenuosity of Europe and America
upon the ease of the Orient, the materialism of
the West upon the spirituality of the East,&ndash;&ndash;this to
us seems to be the principal aim of Khalid. But
often in his wanderings and divagations of thought
does he give us fresh proof of the truism that no two
opposing elements meet and fuse without both losing
their original identity. You may place the bit of contentment
in the mouth of ambition, so to speak, and
jog along in your sterile course between the vast
wheat fields groaning under the thousand-toothed
plough and the gardens of delight swooning with devotion
and sensuality. But cross ambition with contentment
and you get the hinny of indifference or the
monster of fatalism. We do not say that indifference
at certain passes of life, and certain stages, is not
healthy, and fatalism not powerful; but both we believe
are factors as potent in commerce and trade as
pertinacity and calculation. &#8220;But is there not room in
the garden of delight for a wheat field?&#8221; asks Khalid.
&#8220;Can we not apply the bow to the telegraph wires of
the world and make them the vehicle of music as of
stock quotations? Can we not simplify life as we
are simplifying the machinery of industry? Can we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
not consecrate its Temple to the Trinity of Devotion,
Art, and Work, or Religion, Romance, and
Trade?&#8221;</p>
<p>This seems to be the gist of Khalid&#8217;s gospel. This,
through the labyrinths of doubt and contradiction, is
the pinnacle of faith he would reach. And often in
this labyrinthic gloom, where a gleam of light from
some recess of thought or fancy reveals here a Hermit
in his cloister, there an Artist in his studio, below a
Nawab in his orgies, above a Broker on the Stock Exchange,
we have paused to ask a question about these
glaring contrarieties in his life and thought. And
always would he make this reply: &#8220;I have frequently
moved and removed between extremes; I have often
worked and slept in opposing camps. So, do not expect
from me anything like the consistency with which
the majority of mankind solder and shape their life.
Deep thought seems often, if not always, inconsistent
at the first blush. The intensity and passiveness of
the spirit are as natural in their attraction and repulsion
as the elements, whose harmony is only patent
on the surface. Consistency is superficial, narrow,
one-sided. I am both ambitious, therefore, and contented.
My ambition is that of the earth, the ever
producing and resuscitating earth, doing the will of
God, combatting the rasure of time; and my contentment
is that of the majestic pines, faring alike in
shade and sunshine, in calm and storm, in winter as
in spring. Ambition and Contentment are the night
and day of my life-journey. The day makes room
for the fruits of solacement which the night brings;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
and the night gives a cup of the cordial of contentment
to make good the promise of day to day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, while sweating in the tortuous path, I never
cease to cherish the feeling in which I was nourished;
the West for me means ambition, the East, contentment:
my heart is ever in the one, my soul, in the
other. And I care not for the freedom which does
not free both; I seek not the welfare of the one without
the other. But unlike my Ph&oelig;nician ancestors,
the spiritual with me shall not be limited by the
natural; it shall go far above it, beyond or below it,
saturating, sustaining, purifying what in external nature
is but a symbol of the invisible. Nor is my idea
of the spiritual developed in opposition to nature, and
in a manner inimical to its laws and claims, as in
Judaism and Christianity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spiritual and natural are so united, so inextricably
entwined around each other, that I can not
conceive of them separately, independently. And
both in the abstract sense are purportless and ineffectual
without Consciousness. They are blind, dumb
forces, beautiful, barbaric pageants, careering without
aim or design through the immensities of No-where
and No-time, if they are not impregnated and
nourished with Thought, that is to say, with Consciousness,
vitalised and purified. You may impregnate
them with philosophy, nourish them with art;
they both emanate from them, and remain as skidding
clouds, as shining mirages, as wandering dust, until
they find their exponent in Man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell thee then that Man, that is to say Consciousness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
vitalised and purified, in other words Thought&ndash;&ndash;that
alone is real and eternal. And Man is supreme,
only when he is the proper exponent of Nature,
and spirit, and God: the three divine sources from
which he issues, in which he is sustained, and to
which he must return. Nature and the spiritual,
without this embodied intelligence, this somatic being,
called man or angel or ape, are as ermine on a
wax figure. The human factor, the exponent intelligence,
the intellective and sensuous faculties, these,
my Brothers, are whole, sublime, holy, only when, in
a state of continuous expansion, the harmony among
themselves and the affirmative ties between them and
Nature, are perfect and pure. No, the spiritual ought
not and can not be free from the sensuous, even the
sensual. The true life, the full life, the life, pure,
robust, sublime, is that in which all the nobler and
higher aspirations of the soul AND THE BODY are
given free and unlimited scope, with the view of developing
the divine strain in Man, and realising to
some extent the romantic as well as the material
hopes of the race. God, Nature, Spirit, Passion&ndash;&ndash;Passion,
Spirit, Nature, God&ndash;&ndash;in some such panorama
would I paint the life of a highly developed being.
Any of these elements lacking, and the life is
wanting, defective, impure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no faith in men who were conceived in a
perfunctory manner, on a pragmatical system, so to
speak; the wife receiving her husband in bed as she
would a tedious guest at an afternoon tea. Only two
flames uniting produce a third; but a flame and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
name, or a flame and a spunge, produce a hiff and
nothing. Oh, that the children of the race are all
born ph&oelig;nix-like in the fire of noble and sacred
passion, in the purgatory, as it were, of Love. What
a race, what a race we should have. What men, what
women! Yes, that is how the children of the earth
should be conceived, not on a pragmatical system, in
an I-don&#8217;t-care-about-the-issue manner. I believe in
evoking the spirit, in dreaming a little about the gods
of Olympus, and a little, too, about the gods of the
abysmal depths, before the bodily communion. And
in earnest, O my Brother, let us do this, despite
what old Socrates says about the propriety and wisdom
of approaching your wife with prudence and
gravity....&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus, if we did not often halloo, Khalid, like
a huntsman pursuing his game, would lose himself in
the pathless, lugubrious damp of the forest. If we
did not prevent him at times, holding firmly to his
coat-tail, he would desperately pursue the ghost of
his thoughts even on such precipitous paths to those
very depths in which Socrates and Montaigne always
felt at home. But he, a feverish, clamorous, obstreperous
stripling of a Beduin, what chance has he
in extricating his barbaric instincts from such thorny
hedges of philosophy? And had he not quoted Socrates
in that last paragraph, it would have been expunged.
No, we are not utterly lost to the fine sense
of propriety of this chaste and demure age. But no
matter how etiolated and sickly the thought, it regains
its colour and health when it breathes the literary air.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Prudery can not but relish the tang of lubricity when
flavoured with the classical. Moreover, if Socrates
and Montaigne speak freely of these midnight matters,
why not Khalid, if he has anything new to say,
any good advice to offer. But how good and how
new are his views let the Reader judge.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis very well to speak &#8220;of evoking the spirit before
the bodily communion,&#8221; but those who can boast
of a deeper experience in such matters will find in
Socrates&#8217; dictum, quoted by Montaigne, the very gist
of reason and wisdom. Those wise ones were as
far-sighted as they were far gone. And moderation,
as it was justly said once, is the respiration of the
philosopher. But Khalid, though always invoking the
distant luminary of transcendentalism for light, can
not arrogate to himself this high title. The expansion
of all the faculties, and the reduction of the demands
of society and the individual to the lowest
term;&ndash;&ndash;this, as we understand it, is the aim of transcendentalism.
And Khalid&#8217;s distance from the orbit
of this grand luminary seems to vary with his moods;
and these vary with the librations and revolutions of
the moon. Hallucinated, moonstruck Khalid, your
harmonising and affinitative efforts do not always
succeed. That is our opinion of the matter. And
the Reader, who is no respecter of editors, might quarrel
with it, for all we know.</p>
<p>Only by standing firmly in the centre can one preserve
the equilibrium of one&#8217;s thoughts. But Khalid
seldom speaks of equilibrium: he cares not how he
fares in falling on either side of the fence, so he knows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
what lies behind. Howbeit, we can not conceive of how
the affinity of the mind and soul with the senses, and
the harmony between these and nature, are possible,
if not exteriorised in that very superman whom Khalid
so much dreads, and on whom he often casts a
lingering glance of admiration. So there you are.
We must either rise to a higher consciousness on the
ruins of a lower one, of no-consciousness, rather, or
go on seeming and simulating, aspiring, perspiring,
and suffering, until our turn comes. Death denies no
one. Meanwhile, Khalid&#8217;s rhapsodies on his way
back to the city, we shall heed and try to echo.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;On the high road of the universal spirit,&#8221; he
sings, &#8220;the world, the whole world before me, thrilling
and radiating, chanting of freedom, faith, hope,
health and power, and joy. Back to the City, O
Khalid,&ndash;&ndash;the City where Truth, and Faith, and
Honesty, and Wisdom, are ever suffering, ever
struggling, ever triumphing. No, it matters not with
me if the spirit of intelligence and power, of freedom
and culture, which must go the rounds of the earth,
is always dominated by the instinct of self-interest.
That must be; that is inevitable. But the instinct of
self-interest, O my Brother, goes with the flesh; the
body-politic dies; nations rise and fall; and the eternal
Spirit, the progenitor of all ideals, passes to better
or worse hands, still chastening and strengthening
itself in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Orient and Occident, the male and female of
the Spirit, the two great streams in which the body
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
and soul of man are refreshed, invigorated, purified&ndash;&ndash;of
both I sing, in both I glory, to both I consecrate
my life, for both I shall work and suffer and die.
My Brothers, the most highly developed being is
neither European nor Oriental; but rather he who
partakes of the finer qualities of both the European
genius and the Asiatic prophet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me, ye mighty nations of the West, the
material comforts of life; and thou, my East, let me
partake of thy spiritual heritage. Give me, America,
thy hand; and thou, too, Asia. Thou land of origination,
where Light and Spirit first arose, disdain not
the gifts which the nations of the West bring thee;
and thou land of organisation and power, where Science
and Freedom reign supreme, disdain not the
bounties of the sunrise.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the discoveries and attainments of Science will
make the body of man cleaner, healthier, stronger,
happier, the inexhaustible Oriental source of romantic
and spiritual beauty will never cease to give the soul
of man the restfulness and solacement it is ever craving.
And remember, Europa, remember, Asia, that
foreign culture is as necessary to the spirit of a nation
as is foreign commerce to its industries. Elsewise,
thy materialism, Europa, or thy spiritualism, Asia, no
matter how trenchant and impregnable, no matter
how deep the foundation, how broad the superstructure
thereof, is vulgar, narrow, mean&ndash;&ndash;is nothing, in
a word, but parochialism.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear that neither religious nor industrial slavery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
shall forever hold the world in political servitude.
No; the world shall be free of the authority, absolute,
blind, tyrannical, of both the Captains of Industry
and the High Priests of the Temple. And who
shall help to free it? Science alone can not do it;
Science and Faith must do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say with thee, O Goethe, &#8216;Light, more light!&#8217;
I say with thee, O Tolstoi, &#8216;Love, more love!&#8217; I
say with thee, O Ibsen, &#8216;Will, more will!&#8217; Light,
Love, and Will&ndash;&ndash;the one is as necessary as the
other; the one is dangerous without the others.
Light, Love, and Will, are the three eternal, vital
sources of the higher, truer, purer cosmic life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light, Love, and Will&ndash;&ndash;with corals and pearls
from their seas would I crown thee, O my City. In
these streams would I baptise thy children, O my
City. The mind, and the heart, and the soul of man
I would baptise in this mountain lake, this high Jordan
of Truth, on the flourishing and odoriferous
banks of Science and Religion, under the sacred <i>sidr</i>
of Reason and Faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, in the Lakes of Light, Love, and Will, I
would baptise all mankind. For in this alone is
power and glory, O my European Brothers; in this
alone is faith and joy, O my Brothers of Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hudson, the Mississippi, the Amazon, the
Thames, the Seine, the Rhine, the Danube, the Euphrates,
the Ganges&ndash;&ndash;every one of these great
streams shall be such a Jordan in the future. In
every one of them shall flow the confluent Rivers of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
Light, Love, and Will. In every one of them shall
sail the barks of the higher aspirations and hopes of
mankind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I come now to be baptised, O my City. I come
to slake my thirst in thy Jordan. I come to launch
my little skiff, to do my little work, to pay my little
debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;In thy public-squares, O my City, I would raise
monuments to Nature; in thy theatres to Poesy and
Thought; in thy bazaars to Art; in thy homes, to
Health; in thy temples of worship, to universal <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Good-will' across lines">Goodwill;</ins>
in thy courts, to Power and Mercy; in thy
schools, to Simplicity; in thy hospitals, to Faith; and
in thy public-halls to Freedom and Culture. And all
these, without Light, Love, and Will, are but hollow
affairs, high-sounding inanities. Without Light,
Love, and Will, even thy Nabobs in the end shall
curse thee; and with these, thy hammals under their
burdens shall thank the heavens under which thy
domes and turrets and minarets arise.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ON THE OPEN HIGHWAY</h3>
</div>
<p>And Khalid, packing his few worldly belongings
in one of his reed baskets, gives the rest to his
neighbours, leaves his booth in the pines to the swallows,
and bids the monks and his friend the Hermit
farewell. The joy of the wayfaring! Now, where
is the jubbah, the black jubbah of coarse wool, which
we bought from one of the monks? He wraps himself
in it, tightens well his shoe-strings, draws his fur
cap over his ears, carries his basket on his back, takes
up his staff, lights his cigarette, and resolutely sets
forth. The joy of the wayfaring! We accompany
him on the open highway, through the rocky wilderness,
down to the fertile plains, back to the city.
For the account he gives us of his journey enables
us to fill up the lacuna in Shakib&#8217;s <i>Histoire Intime</i>,
before we can have recourse to it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the cliffs &#8217;neath which the lily blooms,&#8221; he
muses as he issues out of the forest and reaches the top
of the mountain, &#8220;to the cliffs round which the eagles
flit,&ndash;&ndash;what a glorious promontory! What a contrast
at this height, in this immensity, between the arid
rocky haunts of the mountain bear and eagle and the
spreading, vivifying verdure surrounding the haunts of
man. On one side are the sylvan valleys, the thick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
grown ravines, the meandering rivulets, the fertile
plains, the silent villages, and on the distant horizon,
the sea, rising like a blue wall, standing like a stage
scene; on the other, a howling immensity of boulders
and prickly shrubs and plants, an arid wilderness&ndash;&ndash;the
haunt of the eagle, the mountain bear, and the
goatherd. One step in this direction, and the entire
panorama of verdant hills and valleys is lost to view.
Its spreading, riant beauty is hidden behind that little
cliff. I penetrate through this forest of rocks, where
the brigands, I am told, lie in ambush for the caravans
traveling between the valley of the Leontes and the
villages of the lowland. But the brigands can not
harm a dervish; my penury is my amulet&ndash;&ndash;my salvation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The horizon, as I proceed, shrinks to a distance of
ten minutes&#8217; walk across. And thus, from one circle
of rocks to another, I pass through ten of them before
I hear again the friendly voice of the rill, and behold
again the comforting countenance of the sylvan slopes.
I reach a little grove of slender poplars, under the brow
of a little hill, from which issues a little limpid stream
and runs gurgling through the little ferns and bushes
down the heath. I swing from the road and follow
this gentle rill; I can not find a better companion now.
But the wanton lures me to a village far from the road
on the other side of the gorge. Now, I must either
retrace my steps to get to it by a long detour, or cross
the gorge, descending to the deep bottom and ascending
in a tangled and tortuous path to reach the main
road on the breast of the opposite escarpment. Here is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
a short-cut which is long and weary. It lures me as
the stream; it cheats me with a name. And when I
am again on the open road, I look back with a sigh of
relief on the dangers I had passed. I can forgive the
luring rill, which still smiles to me innocently from
afar, but not the deluding, ensnaring ravine. The
muleteer who saw me struggling through the tangled
bushes up the pathless, hopeless steep, assures me that
my mother is a pious woman, else I would have slipped
and gone into an hundred pieces among the rocks below.
&#8216;Her prayers have saved thee,&#8217; quoth he; &#8216;thank
thy God.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And walking together a pace, he points to the
dizzy precipice around which I climbed and adds:
&#8216;Thou seest that rock? I hallooed to thee when thou
wert creeping around it, but thou didst not hear me.
From that same rock a woodman fell last week, and,
falling, looked like a potted bird. He must have died
before he reached the ground. His bones are scattered
among those rocks. Thank thy God and thy
mother. Her prayers have saved thee.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear mother, how long since I saw thee, how
long since I thought of thee. My loving mother,
even the rough, rude spirit of a muleteer can see in the
unseen the beauty and benevolence of such devotion as
thine. The words of this dusky son of the road, coming
as through the trumpet of revelation to rebuke me,
sink deep in my heart and draw tears from mine eyes.
For art thou not ever praying for thy grievous son,
and for his salvation? How many beads each night
dost thou tell, how many hours dost thou prostrate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
thyself before the Virgin, sobbing, obsecrating, beating
thy breast? And all for one, who until now, ever
since he left Baalbek, did not think on thee.&ndash;&ndash;Let me
kiss thee, O my Brother, for thy mild rebuke. Let
me kiss thee for reminding me of my mother.&ndash;&ndash;No,
I can not further with thee; I am waygone; I must
sit me a spell beneath this pine&ndash;&ndash;and weep. O Khalid,
wretched that thou art, can the primitive soul of
this muleteer be better than thine? Can there be a
sounder intuitiveness, a healthier sense of love, a
grander sympathy, beneath that striped aba, than there
is within thy cloak? Wilt thou not beat thy cheeks in
ignominy and shame, when a stranger thinks of thy
mother, and reverently, ere thou dost? No matter
how low in the spiritual circles she might be, no matter
how high thou risest, her prayer and her love are
always with thee. If she can not rise to thee on the
ladder of reason, she can soar on the wings of affection.
Yea, I prostrate myself beneath this pine, bury my forehead
in its dust, thanking Allah for my mother. Oh,
I am waygone, but joyous. The muleteer hath illumined
thee, O Khalid.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, the snow birds are passing by, flitting to
the lowland. The sky is overcast; there is a lull in
the wind. Hark, I hear the piping of the shepherd
and the tinkling bell of the wether. Yonder is his
flock; and there sits he on a rock blowing his doleful
reed. I am almost slain with thirst. I go to him,
and cheerfully does he milk for me. I do not think
Rebekah was kinder and sweeter in Abraham&#8217;s servant&#8217;s
eyes than was this wight in mine. &#8216;Where dost thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
sleep?&#8217; I ask, &#8216;Under this rock,&#8217; he replies. And he
shows me into the cave beneath it, which is furnished
with a goat-skin, a masnad, and a little altar for the
picture of the Virgin. Before this picture is an oil
lamp, ever burning, I am told. &#8216;And this altar,&#8217; quoth
the shepherd, &#8216;was my mother&#8217;s. When she died she
bequeathed it to me. I carry it with me in the wilderness,
and keep the oil burning in her memory.&#8217; Saying
which he took to weeping. Even the shepherd, O Khalid,
is sent to rebuke thee. I thank him, and resume
my march.</p>
<p>&#8220;At eventide, descending from one hilltop to another,
I reach a village of no mean size. It occupies
a broad deep steep, in which the walnut and poplar
relieve the monotony of the mulberries. I hate the
mulberry, which is so suggestive of worms; and I
hate worms, and though they be of the silk-making
kind. I hate them the more, because the Lebanon
peasant seems to live for the silk-worms, which
he tends and cultivates better than he does his children.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I stood on the top of the steep, the village
glittering with a thousand lights lay beneath like a
strip of the sidereal sky. It made me feel I was
above the clouds, even above the stars. The gabled
houses overtopping each other, spreading in clusters
and half-circles, form here an aigrette, as it were, on
the sylvan head of the mountain, there a necklace on
its breast, below a cestus brilliant with an hundred
lights. I descend into the village and stop before the
first house I reach. The door is wide open; and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
little girl who sees me enter runs in fright to tell her
mother. Straightway, the woman and her son, a
comely and lusty youth, come out in a where-is-the-brigand
manner, and, as they see me, stand abashed,
amazed. The young man who wore a robe-de-chambre
and Turkish slippers worked in gold, returns
my salaam courteously and invites me up to the divan.
There is a spark of intelligence in his eyes, and an
alien affectation in his speech. I foresaw that he had
been in America. He does not ask me the conventional
questions about my religious persuasion; but
after his inquiries of whence and whither, he offers
me an Egyptian cigarette, and goes in to order the
coffee. It did not occur to him that I was his guest
for the night.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah me, I no longer know how to recline on a
cushion, and a rug under my feet seems like a sheet of
ice. But with my dust and mud I seem like Diogenes
trampling upon Plato&#8217;s pride. I survey the hall,
which breathes of rural culture and well-being, and
in which is more evidence of what I foresaw. On the
wall hung various photographs and oil prints, among
which I noticed those of the King and Queen of
England, that of Theodore Roosevelt, a framed cartoon
by an American artist, an autographed copy of
an English Duke&#8217;s, and a large photograph of a banquet
of one of the political Clubs of New York. On
the table were a few Arabic magazines, a post-card
album, and a gramophone! Yes, mine host was more
than once in the United States. And knowing that I,
too, had been there, he is anxious to display somewhat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
of his broken English. His father, he tells me,
speaks English even as good as he does, having been a
dragoman for forty years.</p>
<p>&#8220;After supper, he orders me a narghilah, and winds
for my entertainment that horrible instrument of torture.&#8221;
Khalid did not seem to mind it; but he was
anxious about the sacred peace of the hills, sleeping in
the bosom of night. My Name is Billy Muggins, I
Wish I Had a Pal Like You, Tickle Me, Timothy,
and such like ragtime horrors come all the way from
America to violate the antique grandeur and beauty
of the Lebanon hills. That is what worried Khalid.
And he excuses himself, saying, &#8220;I am waygone from
the day&#8217;s wayfaring.&#8221; The instrument of torture is
stopped, therefore, and he is shown into a room where
a mattress is spread for him on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;mine host accompanies
me through the populous village, which is
noted for its industries. Of all the Lebanon towns,
this is, indeed, the busiest; its looms, its potteries, and
its bell foundries, are never idle. And the people
cultivate little of the silk worm; they are mostly
artisans. American cotton they spin, and dye, and
weave into substantial cloth; Belgian iron they melt
and cast into bells; and from their native soil they
dig the clay which they mould into earthenware.
The tintinnabulations of the loom can be heard in
other parts of the Lebanons; but no where else can
the vintner buy a dolium for his vine, or the housewife,
a pipkin for her oil, or the priest, a bell for his
church. The sound of these foundries&#8217; anvils, translated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
into a wild, thrilling, far-reaching music, can be
heard in every belfry and bell-cote of Syria.</p>
<p>&#8220;We descend to the potteries below, not on the
carriage road which serpentines through the village,
and which is its only street, but sheer down a steep
path, between the noise of the loom and spinning
wheel and the stench of the dyeing establishments.
And here is the real potter and his clay, not the symbol
thereof. And here is the pottery which is illustrated
in the Bible. For in the world to-day, if we
except the unglazed tinajas of the Pueblo Indians,
nothing, above ground at least, can be more ancient
and primitive. Such a pitcher, I muse, did Rebekah
carry to the well; with such a Jar on her shoulder
did Hagar wander in the wilderness; and in such
vessels did the widow, by Elijah&#8217;s miracle, multiply
her jug of oil.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one silk-reeling factory of the village, I did
not care to visit; for truly I can not tolerate the smell
of asphyxiated larvas and boiling cocoons. &#8216;But the
proprietor,&#8217; quoth mine host, &#8216;is very honourable, and
of a fine wit.&#8217; As honourable as a sweater can be, I
thought. No, no; these manufacturers are all of a
piece. I know personally one of them, who is a
Scrooge, and of the vilest. I watched him one day
buying cocoons from the peasants. He does not trust
any of his employees at the scales; they do not know
how to press their hand over the weights in the pan.
Ay, that little pressure of his chubby hand on the
weights makes a difference in his favour of more than
ten per cent. of what he buys. That little pressure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
of his hand is five or six piasters out of the peasant&#8217;s
pocket, who, with five or six piasters, remember, can
satisfy his hunger on bread and olives and pulverised
thyme, for five or six days. So, we visit not the
cocoon-man, about whom the priest of his private
chapel&ndash;&ndash;he prays at home like the Lebanon Amirs
of old, this khawaja&ndash;&ndash;tells me many edifying things.
Of these, I give out the most curious and least injurious.
As the sheikh (squire) of the town, he is
generous; as the operator of a silk-reeling factory, he is
grasping, niggardly, mean. For, to misgovern well,
one must open his purse as often as he forces the
purses of others. He was passing by in his carriage
this great khawaja, when we were coming out of the
pottery. And of a truth, his paunch and double chin
and ruddy cheeks seemed to illustrate what the priest
told me about his usurious propensities.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a contrast between him and the swarthy,
leathery, hungry-looking potters. I can not think
that Nature has aught to do with these naked inequalities.
I can not believe that, to produce one
roseate complexion, she must etiolate a thousand. I
can not see how, in drinking from the same gushing
spring, and breathing the same mountain air, and
basking in the same ardent sun, the khawaja gets a
double chin and the peasant a double curse. But his
collops and his ruddiness are due to the fact that he
misgoverns as well as his Pasha and his Sultan. He
battens, even like a Tammany chief, on political jobbery,
on extortion, on usury. His tree is better
manured, so to speak; manured by the widows and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
tended by the orphans of his little kingdom. In a
word, this great khawaja is what I call a political
coprophagist. Hence, his suspicious growth, his lustre
and lustiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is not the only example in the village of
this superabundance of health; the priests are many
more. For I must not fail to mention that, in addition
to its potteries and founderies, the town is blessed
with a dozen churches. Every family, a sort of tribe,
has its church and priests; and consequently, its feuds
with all the others. It is a marvel how the people,
in the lethal soot and smoke of strife and dissension,
can work and produce anything. Farewell, ye
swarthy people! Farewell, O village of bells and potteries!
Were it not for the khawaja who misgoverns
thee, and the priests who sow their iniquity in thee,
thou shouldst have been an ideal town. I look back,
as I descend into the wadi, and behold, thou art as
beautiful in the day as thou art in the night. Thy
pink gables under a December sky seem not as garish
as they do in summer. And the sylvan slopes, clustered
with thy white-stone homes, peeping here
through the mulberries, standing there under the walnuts
and poplars, rising yonder in a group like a
mottled pyramid, this most picturesque slope, whereon
thou art ever beating the anvil, turning the wheel,
throwing the shuttle, moulding the clay, and weltering
withal in the mud of strife and dissension, this
beautiful slope seems, nevertheless, from this distance,
like an altar raised to Nature. I look not upon thee
more; farewell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I descend in the wadi to the River Lykos of the
ancients; and crossing the stone-bridge, an hour&#8217;s
ascent brings me to one of the villages of Kisrawan.
On the grey horizon yonder, is the limed bronze
Statue of Mary the Virgin, rising on its sable pedestal,
and looking, from this distance, like a candle in a
bronze candle-stick. That Statue, fifty years hence,
the people of the Lebanons will rebaptise as the Statue
of Liberty. Masonry, even to-day, raises around it
her mace. But whether these sacred mountains will
be happier and more prosperous under its r&eacute;gime, I
can not say. The Masons and the Patriarch of the
Maronites are certainly more certain. Only this I
know, that between the devil and the deep sea, Mary
the Virgin shall hold her own. For though the
name be changed, and the alm-box thrown into the
sea, she shall ever be worshipped by the people. The
Statue of the Holy Virgin of Liberty it will be called,
and the Jesuits and priests can go a-begging. Meanwhile,
the Patriarch will issue his allocutions, and the
Jesuits, their pamphlets, against rationalism, atheism,
masonry, and other supposed enemies of their Blessed
Virgin, and point them out as enemies of Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid.
&#8217;Tis curious how the Sultan of the Ottomans
can serve the cause of the Virgin!</p>
<p>&#8220;I visit the Statue for the love of my mother, and
mounting to the top of the pedestal, I look up and
behold my mother before me. The spectre of her,
standing before the monument, looks down upon me,
reproachfully, piteously, affectionately. I sit down
at the feet of the Virgin Mary and bury my face in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
my hands and weep. I love what thou lovest, O my
mother, but I can see no more what thou seest. For
thy love, O my mother, these kisses and tears. For
thy love, I stand here like a child, and look up to this
inanimate figure as I did when I was an acolyte.
My intellect, O my mother, I would drown in my
tears, and thy faith I would stifle with my kisses.
Only thus is reconciliation possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving this throne of modern mythology, I cross
many wadis, descend and ascend many hills, pass
through many villages, until I reach, at Ghina and
Masshnaka, the tomb of the mythology of the ancients.
At Ghina are ruins and monuments, of which Time
has spared enough to engage the interest of arch&aelig;ologists.
Let the P&egrave;res Jesuit, Bourquenoud and Roz,
make boast of their discoveries and scholarship; I can
only boast of the fact that the ceremonialisms of worship
are the same to-day as they were in the days of
my Ph&oelig;nician ancestors. Which, indeed, speaks well
for THEM. This tablet, representing an armed
figure and a bear, commemorates, it is said, the death
of Tammuz. And the figure of the weeping woman
near it is probably that of Ashtaroth. Other figures
there are; but nothing short of the scholarship of
Bourquenoud and Roz can unveil their marble
mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Masshnaka, overlooking the River Adonis, are
ruins of an ancient temple in which can still be seen a
few Corinthian columns. This, too, we are told, was
consecrated to Tammuz; and in this valley the women
of Byblus bemoaned every year the fate of their god.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
Isis and Osiris, Tammuz and Ashtaroth, Venus and
Adonis,&ndash;&ndash;these, I believe, are one and the same.
Their myth borrowed from the Ph&oelig;nicians, the Egyptians,
and the Romans, from either of the two. But
the Venus of Rome is cheerful, joyous, that of the
Ph&oelig;nicians is sad and sorrowful. Even mythology
triumphs in its evolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, where my forebears deliquesced in sensuality,
devotion, and grief, where the ardency of the
women of Byblus flamed on the altar of Tammuz, on
this knoll, whose trees and herbiage are fed perchance
with their dust, I build my <i>athafa</i> (little kitchen),
Arab-like, and cook my noonday meal. On the
three stones, forming two right angles, I place my skillet,
kindle under it a fire, pour into it a little sweet
oil, and fry the few eggs I purchased in the village.
I abominate the idea of frying eggs in water as the
Americans do.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> I had as lief fry them in vinegar or
syrup, where neither olive oil nor goat-butter is obtainable.
But to fry eggs in water? O the barbarity
of it! Why not, my friend, take them boiled and
drink a little hot water after them? This savours of
originality, at least, and is just as insipid, if not more.
Withal, they who boil cabbage, and heap it in a plate
over a slice of corn-beef, and call it a dish, can break
a few boiled eggs in a cup of hot water and call them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
fried. Be this as it may. The Americans will be
solesistically simple even in their kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my skillet of eggs being ready, I draw out
of my basket a cake of cheese, a few olives, an onion,
and three paper-like loaves, rather leaves, of bread,
and fall to. With what relish, I need not say. But
let it be recorded here, that under the karob tree, on
the bank of the River Adonis, in the shadow of the
great wall surrounding the ruins of the temple of
Tammuz, I Khalid, in the thirty-fourth year of the
reign of Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid, gave a banquet to the gods&ndash;&ndash;who,
however, were content in being present and applauding
the devouring skill of the peptic host and
toast-master. Even serene Majesty at Yieldiz would
give away, I think, an hundred of its sealed dishes for
such a skillet of eggs in such an enchanted scene.
But for it, alas! such wild and simple joy is a sealed
book. Poor Serene Majesty! Now, having gone
through the fruit course&ndash;&ndash;and is not the olive a
fruit?&ndash;&ndash;I fill my jug at the River to make my coffee.
And here I ask, In what Hotel Cecil or Waldorf
or Savoy, or in what Arab tent in the desert,
can one get a better cup of coffee than this, which
Khalid makes for himself? The gods be praised, before
and after. Ay, even in washing my pots and
dishes I praise the good gods.</p>
<p>&#8220;And having done this, I light my cigarette, lug
my basket on my back, and again set forth. In three
hours, on my way to Byblus, I reach a hamlet situated
in a deep narrow wadi, closed on all sides by huge
mountain walls. The most sequestered, the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
dreary place, I have yet seen. Here, though unwilling,
the dusk of the December day having set in, I lay
down the staff of wayfare. And as I enter the little
village, I am greeted by the bleat of sheep and the low
of the kine. The first villager I meet is an aged
woman, who stands in her door before which is a
pomegranate tree, telling her beads. She returns my
salaam graciously, and invites me, saying, &#8216;Be kind to
tarry overnight.&#8217; But can one be kinder than such an
hostess? Seeing that I laid down my burden, she
calls to her daughter to light the seraj (naphtha lamp)
and bring some water for the stranger. &#8216;Methinks
thou wouldst wash thy feet,&#8217; quoth she. Indeed, that
is as essential and refreshing, after a day&#8217;s walk, as
washing one&#8217;s face. I sit me down, therefore, under
the pomegranate, take off my shoes and stockings, and
the little girl, a winsome, dark-eyed, quick-witted lass,
pours to me from the pitcher. I try to take it from
her; but she would not, she said, be deprived of the
pleasure of serving the stranger. Having done, I put
on my stockings, and, leaving my shoes and basket
near the door, enter a beit (one-room house) meagrely
but neatly furnished. The usual straw mats are
spread on the winter side, behind the door; in the
corner is a little linen-covered divan with trimming of
beautiful hand-made lace, the work of the little girl;
and nearby are a few square cushions on the floor and
a crude chair. The seraj, giving out more smoke and
smell than light, is placed on a little shelf attached
to the central pillar of the beit. Near the door is a
bench for the water jars, and in the other corner are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
the mattresses and quilts, and the earthen tub containing
the round leaves of bread. Of these consist the
furniture and provision of mine hostess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her son, a youth of not more than two score
years, returns from his day&#8217;s labour a while after I
had arrived. And as he stands in the door, his pick-axe
and spade on his shoulder, his sister runs to meet
him, and whispers somewhat about the stranger.
Sitting on the threshold, he takes off his spats of cloth
and his clouted shoes, while she gets the pitcher of
water. After having washed, he enters, salaams
graciously, and squats on the floor. The mother then
brings a wicker tray on which is set the supper, consisting
of only bread and olives. &#8216;Thou wilt overlook
our penury,&#8217; she falters out; &#8216;here be all we
have.&#8217; In truth, my hostess is of the poorest of the
Lebanon peasants; even her sweet-oil pipkin and her
jars of lentils and beans, are empty. She lays the tray
before her son and invites me to partake of the repast.
I go to my basket, bring forth the few onions and the
two cakes of cheese I had left, lay them with an
apology on the tray&ndash;&ndash;the mother, abashed, protests&ndash;&ndash;and
we sit down cross-legged in a circle to supper.
When we rise, the little girl lights a little fire, and
they enjoy the cup of coffee I make for them. And
the mother, in taking hers, tells me na&iuml;vely, and with
a sigh, that it is five years now since she had had a
cup of coffee. Indeed, she had seen better days.
And &#8217;tis sorrow, forestalling Time, which furrows
her cheeks and robs her black eyes of their lustre and
spark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She had once cattle, and a beit of her own, and
rugs, too, and jars full of provision. But now she is
a tenant. And her husband, ever since he emigrated
to America, did not send a single piaster or even write
a letter. From necessity she becomes a prey of
usurers; for those Lebanon Moths, of which we saw
a specimen in the village of bells and potteries, fall
mostly in the wardrobe of women. They are locusts
rather, who visit only the wheat fields of the poor.
Her home was mortgaged to one such, and failing
to meet her obligation, the mortgage is closed and he
takes possession. Soon after she is evicted, her son,
the first-born, a youth of much promise, dies.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He could read and write, my son,&#8217; quoth she,
sobbing; &#8216;of a sharp wit he was, and very assiduous
in his studies. Once he accompanied the priest of
the village on a visit to the Patriarch, and read there
a eulogium of his own composition, for which he
received a silver medal. The Patriarch then sent
him to a Seminary; he was to become a priest, my
son. He wrote a beautiful hand&ndash;&ndash;both Arabic and
French; he was of a fine wit, sharp, quick, brilliant.
Ah, me, but those who are of such minds never
live!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She then tells me how they lost their last head
of cattle. An excellent sheep it was; which one night
they forgot outside; and the wolf, visiting the village,
sees it tied to the mulberry, howls for joy, and
carries it off. And thus Death robs the poor woman of
her son; America, of her husband; the Shylock of the
village, of her home; and the wolf, of her last head of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
cattle. And this were enough to age even a Spartan
woman. Late in the evening, after she had related at
length of her sorrows, three mattresses&ndash;&ndash;all she had&ndash;&ndash;are
laid on the straw mat near each other, and the little
girl had to sleep with her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early in the morning I bid them farewell, and
pass on my way to Amsheet, where Henriette Renan,
the sister of Ernest, is buried. An hour&#8217;s walk, and
the incarcerated wadi and its folk lie concealed behind.
I breathe again the open air of the mountain expanse;
I behold again the emerald stretch of water on the
horizon, where the baggalas and saics, from this distance,
seem like doves basking in the morning sun. I
cross the last rill, mount the last hilltop on my
journey, and lo, at the foot of the gently sloping heath
are the orchards and palms of Amsheet. Further below
is Jbail, or ancient Byblus, looking like a clutter
of cliffs on the shore. Farewell to the mountain
heights, and the arid wilderness! Welcome the fertile
plains, and hopeful strands. In half an hour I
reach the immense building&ndash;&ndash;the first or the last of
the village, according to your direction&ndash;&ndash;which, from
the top of the hill, I thought to be a fortress. A
huge structure this, still a-building, and of an architecture
altogether different from the conventional
Lebanon type. No plain square affair, with three
pointed arches in the fa&ccedil;ade, and a gable of pink tiles;
but here are quoins, oriels, embrasures, segmental
arches, and other luxuries of architecture. Out of
place in these wilds, altogether out of place. Hard
by are two primitive flat-roofed beits, standing grimly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
there as a rebuke to the extravagant tendencies of the
age. I go there in the hope of buying some cheese
and eggs, and behold a lady of severe beauty smoking a
narghilah and giving orders to a servant. She returns
my salaam seated in her chair, and tells me in
an injured air, after I had made known to her my
desire, that eggs and cheese are sold in the stores.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You may come in for breakfast,&#8217; she adds; and
clapping for the servant, orders him to lay the table
for me. I enter the beit, which is partitioned into
a kitchen, a dining-room, and a parlour. On the table
is spread the usual breakfast of a Lebanonese of
affluence: namely, cheese, honey, fig-jam, and green
olives. The servant, who is curious to know my
name, my religion, my destination, and so forth, tells
me afterwards that Madame is the wife of the kaiemkam,
and the castle, which is building, is their new
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming out, I thank Madame, and ask her about
the grave of Renan&#8217;s sister. She pauses amazed,
blows her narghilah smoke in my face, surveys me
from top to toe, and puts to me those same questions
with which I was tormented by her servant. Indeed,
I had answered ten of hers, before I got this answer
to mine: &#8216;The sister of whom, thou sayst? That
Frenchman who came here in the sixties for antiquities?
Yes; his sister died and was buried here,
but no Christian remembers her for good. She must
have been a bad one like her brother, who was an
infidel, they say, and did not know or fear God.&ndash;&ndash;What
wouldst thou see there? Art like the idiot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Franje (Europeans) who come here and carry away
from around the grave some stones and dust? Go
thou with him&ndash;&ndash;(this to the servant) and show him
the vault of the Toubeiyahs, where she was buried.&#8217;
This, in a supercilious air, while she drew from
the narghilah the smoke, which I could not relish.</p>
<p>&#8220;We come to the cemetery near the church in the
centre of the town. The vault where Henriette was
laid, a plain, plastered square cell, is not far from an
oak which in the morning envelopes it with its shadow;
and directly across are palms, whose shades at sundown,
make a vain effort to kiss its dust. No grass,
no flowers around; but much of the dust of neglect.
And of this I take up a handful, like &#8216;the idiot
Franje&#8217;; but instead of carrying it away, I press
therein my lips and leave my planted kisses near
the vault.&ndash;&ndash;When the mothers and the sisters of these
sacred hills, O Henriette, can see the flowers of these
kisses in thy dust, when they can appreciate the sacred
purity of thy spirit and devotion, what mothers then
we shall have, and what sisters!</p>
<p>&#8220;I pass through the village descending on the carriage
road to Jbail, or Byblus. In these diggings the
shrewd antiquary digs for those precious tear-bottles
of my ancestors. And everywhere one turns are tombs
in which the arch&aelig;ologist finds somewhat to noise
abroad. His, indeed, is a scholarship which is essentially
necrophagous. For consider, what would become
of it, if a necropolis, for instance, did not yield
somewhat of nourishment,&ndash;&ndash;a limb, a torso, a palimpsest,
or even an earthen lamp, a potsherd, or a coin?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
I rail not at these scholarly grave-diggers because I
can not interest myself in their work; that were unwise
and unfair. But truly, I abominate this business
of &#8216;cashing,&#8217; as it were, the ruins and remains, the
ashes and dust, of our ancestors. Arch&aelig;ology for
arch&aelig;ology&#8217;s sake is pardonable; arch&aelig;ology for the
sake of writing a book is intolerable; and arch&aelig;ology
for lucre is abominable.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Jbail I visited the citadel, said to be of Ph&oelig;nician
origin, which is occupied by the mudir of the
District. Entering the gate, near which is a chapel
consecrated to Our Lady of that name, where litigants,
when they can not prove their claims, are made
to swear to them, we pass through a court between
rows of Persian lilac trees, into a dark, stivy arcade
on both sides of which are dark, stivy cells used as
stables. Reaching the citadel proper, we mount a
high stairway to the loft occupied by the mudir.
This, too, is partitioned, but with cotton sheeting, into
various apartments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The zabtie, in zouave uniform, at the door, would
have me wait standing in the corridor outside; for
his Excellency is at dinner. And Excellency, as affable
as his zabtie, hearing the parley without, growls
behind the scene and orders me gruffly to go to the
court. &#8216;This is not the place to make a complaint,&#8217;
he adds. But the stranger at thy door, O gracious
Excellency, complains not against any one in this
world; and if he did, assure thee, he would not complain
to the authorities of this world. This, or some
such plainness of distemper, the zouave communicates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
to his superior behind the cotton sheeting, who presently
comes out, his anger somewhat abated, and, taking
me for a monk&ndash;&ndash;my jubbah is responsible for the
deception&ndash;&ndash;invites me to the sitting-room in the
enormous loophole of the citadel. He himself was
beginning to complain of the litigants who pester him
at his home, and apologise for his ill humour, when
suddenly, disabused on seeing my trousers beneath
my jubbah, he subjects me to the usual cross-examination.
I could not refrain from thinking that, not
being of the cowled gentry, he regretted having
honoured me with an apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;But after knowing somewhat of the pilgrim
stranger, especially that he had been in America, Excellency
tempers the severity of his expression and
evinces an agreeable curiosity. He would know many
things of that distant country; especially about a
Gold-Mining Syndicate, or Gold-Mining Fake, in
which he invested a few hundred pounds of his fortune.
And I make reply, &#8216;I know nothing about Gold
Mines and Syndicates, Excellency: but methinks if
there be gold in such schemes, the grubbing, grabbing
Americans would not let it come to Syria.&#8217; &#8216;Indeed,
so,&#8217; he murmurs, musing; &#8216;indeed, so.&#8217; And
clapping for the serving-zabtie&ndash;&ndash;the mudirs and
kaiemkams of the Lebanon make these zabties, whose
duty is to serve papers, serve, too, in their homes&ndash;&ndash;he
orders for me a cup of coffee. And further complaining
to me, he curses America for robbing the country
of its men and labourers.&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;We can no more find tenants
for our estates, despite the fact that they get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
more of the income than we do. The shreek
(partner), or tenant, is rightly called so. For the
owner of an estate that yields fifty pounds, for instance,
barely gets half of it; while the shreek, he
who tills and cultivates the land, gets away with the
other half, sniffing and grumbling withal. Of a
truth, land-tenants are not so well-off anywhere. And
if the land but yields a considerable portion, any one
with a few grains of the energy of those Americans,
would prefer to be a shreek than a real-estate owner.&#8217;
Thus, his Excellency, complaining of the times, regretting
his losses, cursing America and its Gold
Mines; and having done, drops the narghilah tube
from his hand and dozes on the divan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I muse meanwhile on Time, who sees in a citadel
of the ancient Ph&oelig;nicians, after many thousand years,
that same propensity for gold, that same instinct for
trade. The Ph&oelig;nicians worked gold mines in
Thrace, and the Syrians, their descendants, are working
gold mines in America. But are we as daring,
as independent, as honest? I am not certain, however,
if those Ph&oelig;nicians had anything to do with bubbles.
My friend Sanchuniathon writes nothing on the subject.
History records not a single instance of a gold-mine
bubble in Thrace, or a silver ditto in Africa.
Apart from this, have we, the descendants of those
honest Ph&oelig;nicians, any of their inventive skill and
bold initiative? They taught other nations the art
of ship-building; we can not as much as learn from
other nations the art of building a gig. They transmitted
to the people of the West a knowledge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
mathematics, weights, and measures; we can not as
much as weigh or measure the little good Europe is
transmitting to us. They always fought bravely
against their conquerors, always gave evidence of their
love of independence; and we dare not raise a finger
or whisper a word against the red Tyrant by whom
we are degraded and enslaved. We are content in
paying tribute to a criminal Government for pressing
upon our necks the yoke and fettering hopelessly our
minds and souls&ndash;&ndash;and my brave Ph&oelig;nicians, ah, how
bravely they thought and fought. What daring
deeds they accomplished! what mysteries of art and
science they unveiled!</p>
<p>&#8220;On these shores they hammered at the door of
invention, and, entering, showed the world how glass
is made; how colours are extracted from pigments;
how to measure, and count, and communicate human
thought. The swarthy sons of the eternal billows,
how shy they were of the mountains, how enamoured
of the sea! For the mountains, it was truly said,
divide nations, and the seas connect them. And
my Ph&oelig;nicians, mind you, were for connection
always. Everywhere, they lived on the shores, and
ever were they ready to set sail.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this mammoth loophole, measuring about ten
yards in length,&ndash;&ndash;this the thickness of the wall&ndash;&ndash;I
muse of another people skilled in the art of building.
But between the helots who built the pyramids and
the freemen who built this massive citadel, what a
contrast! The Egyptian mind could only invent
fables; the Ph&oelig;nician was the vehicle of commerce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
and the useful arts. The Egyptians would protect
their dead from the tyranny of Time; the Ph&oelig;nicians
would protect themselves, the living, from the invading
enemy: those based their lives on the vagaries of
the future; these built it on the solid rock of the
present....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>But we have had enough of Khalid&#8217;s gush about the
Ph&oelig;nicians, and we confess we can not further walk
with him on this journey. So, we leave his Excellency
the mudir snoring on the divan, groaning under
the incubus of the Gold Mine Fake, bemoaning his
losses in America; pass the zabtie in zouave uniform,
who is likewise snoring on the door-step; and, hurrying
down the stairway and out through the stivy
arcade, we say farewell to Our Lady of the Gate, and
get into one of the carriages which ply the shore
between Junie and Jbail. We reach Junie about
sundown, and Allah be praised! Even this toy of
a train brings us, in thirty minutes, to Beirut.</p>
<hr class='fn' />
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0004' id='Footnote_0004'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0004'><span class='label'>[1]</span></a>
<p>
Khalid would speak here of poached eggs, we believe.
And the Americans, to be fair, are not so totally ignorant
of the art of frying. They have lard&ndash;&ndash;much worse than
water&ndash;&ndash;in which they cook, or poach, or fry&ndash;&ndash;but the
change in the name does not change the taste. So, we let
Khalid&#8217;s stricture on fried eggs and boiled cabbage stand.&ndash;&ndash;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Editor.</span>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>UNION AND PROGRESS</h3>
</div>
<p>Had not Khalid in his retirement touched his philosophic
raptures with a little local colouring, had
he not given an account of his tramping tour
in the Lebanons, the hiatus in Shakib&#8217;s <i>Histoire Intime</i>
could not have been bridged. It would have
remained, much to our vexation and sorrow, somewhat
like the ravine in which Khalid almost lost his
life. But now we return, after a year&#8217;s absence, to
our Scribe, who at this time in Baalbek is soldering
and hammering out rhymes in praise of Niazi and
Enver, Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid and the Dastur (Constitution).</p>
<p>&#8220;When Khalid, after his cousin&#8217;s marriage, suddenly
disappeared from Baalbek,&#8221; writes he, &#8220;I felt
that something had struck me violently on the brow,
and everything around me was dark. I could not
withhold my tears: I wept like a child, even like
Khalid&#8217;s mother. I remember he would often speak
of suicide in those days. And on the evening of that
fatal day we spent many hours discussing the question.
&#8216;Why is not one free to kill himself,&#8217; he
finally asked, &#8216;if one is free to become a Jesuit?&#8217;
But I did not believe he was in earnest. Alas, he
was. For on the morning of the following day, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
went up to his tent on the roof and found nothing of
Khalid&#8217;s belongings but a pamphlet on the subject,
&#8216;Is Suicide a Sin?&#8217; and right under the title the
monosyllable LA (no) and his signature. The frightfulness
of his intention stood like a spectre before
me. I clapped one hand upon the other and wept.
I made inquiries in the city and in the neighbouring
places, but to no purpose. Oh, that dreadful, dismal
day, when everywhither I went something seemed to
whisper in my heart, &#8216;Khalid is no more.&#8217; It was
the first time in my life that I felt the pangs of separation,
the sting of death and sorrow. The days and
months passed, heartlessly confirming my conjecture,
my belief.</p>
<p>&#8220;One evening, when the last glimmer of hope
passed away, I sat down and composed a threnody in
his memory. And I sent it to one of the newspapers
of Beirut, in the hope that Khalid, if he still lived,
might chance to see it. It was published and quoted
by other journals here and in Egypt, who, in their
eulogies, spoke of Khalid as the young Baalbekian
philosopher and poet. One of these newspapers,
whose editor is a dear friend of mine, and of comely
ancient virtue, did not mention, from a subtle sense
of tender regard for my feelings, the fact that Khalid
committed suicide. &#8216;He died,&#8217; the Notice said, &#8216;of
a sudden and violent defluxion of rheums,<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> which baffled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
the physician and resisted his skill and physic.&#8217;
Another journal, whose editor&#8217;s religion is of the
Jesuitical pattern, spoke of him as a miserable God-abandoned
wretch who was not entitled to the right
of Christian burial; and fulminated at its contemporaries
for eulogising the youthful infidel and moaning
his death, thus spreading and justifying his evil
example.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so, the days passed, and the months, and
Khalid was still dead. In the summer of this year,
when the Constitution was proclaimed, and the
country was rioting in the saturnalia of Freedom
and Equality, my sorrow was keener, deeper than
ever. Not I alone, but the cities and the deserts of
Syria and Arabia, missed my loving friend. How
gloriously he would have filled the tribune of the day,
I sadly mused.... O Khalid, I can never forgive
this crime of thine against the sacred rites of
Friendship. Such heartlessness, such inexorable
cruelty, I have never before observed in thee. No
matter how much thou hast profited by thy retirement
to the mountains, no matter how much thy
solitude hath given thee of health and power and
wisdom, thy cruel remissness can not altogether be
drowned in my rejoicing. To forget those who love
thee above everything else in the world,&ndash;&ndash;thy mother,
thy cousin, thine affectionate brother&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And our Scribe goes on, blubbering like a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
Syrian his complaint and joy, gushing now in verse,
now in what is worse, in rhymed prose, until he
reaches the point which is to us of import. Khalid,
in the winter of the first year of the Dastur (Constitution)
writes to him many letters from Beirut,
of which he gives us not less than fifty! And of
these, the following, if not the most piquant and interesting,
are the most indispensable to our History.</p>
<p>Letter I (As numbered in the Original)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My loving Brother Shakib:</p>
<p>To whom, if not to you, before all, should I send
the first word of peace, the first sign of the resurrection?
To my mother? To my cousin Najma?
Well, yes. But if I write to them, my letters will be
brought to you to be read and answered. So I write
now direct, hoping that you will convey to them these
tidings of joy. &#8217;Tis more than a year now since I
slinked out of Baalbek, leaving you in the dark about
me. Surely, I deserve the chastisement of your bitterest
thoughts. But what could I do? Such is
the rigour of the sort of life I lived that any communication
with the outside world, especially with friends
and lovers, would have marred it. So, I had to be
silent as the pines in which I put up, until I became
as healthy as the swallows, my companions there.
When we meet, I shall recount to you the many curious
incidents of my solitude and my journey in the
sacred hills of Lebanon. To these auspicious mountains,
my Brother, I am indebted for the health and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
joy and wisdom that are now mine; and yours, too,
if you consider.</p>
<p>Strange, is it not, that throughout my journey,
and I have passed in many villages, nothing heard I
of this great political upheaval in the Empire. Probably
the people of the Lebanons cherish not the Revolution.
There is so much in common, I find, between
them and the Celtic races, who always in such
instances have been more royalists than the king.
And I think Mt. Lebanon is going to be the Vend&eacute;e
of the Turks.</p>
<p>I have been in Beirut but a few days. And
truly, I could not believe my eyes, when in the Place
de la Concorde (I hope the Turks are not going to
follow in the steps of the French Revolutionists in all
things), I could not believe my eyes, when, in this
muddy Square, on the holy Stump of Liberty, I beheld
my old friend the Spouter dispensing to the turbaned
and tarboushed crowd, among which were
cameleers and muleteers with their camels and mules,
of the blessing of that triple political abracadabra of
the France of more than a century passed. Liberty,
Fraternity, Equality!&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s a shame that the show
has been running for six months now and I did not
know it. I begin by applauding the Spouters of Concord
Square, the donkey that I am. But how, with
my cursed impulsiveness, can I always keep on the
sidewalk of reason? I, who have suckled of the milk
of freedom and broke the bottle, too, on my Nurse&#8217;s
head, I am not to blame, if from sheer joy, I cheer
those who are crowning her on a dung-hill with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
wreaths of stable straw. It&#8217;s better, billah, than
breaking the bottle on her head, is it not? And so,
let the Spouters spout. And let the sheikh and the
priest and the rabbi embrace on that very Stump and
make up. Live the Era of Concord and peace and
love! Live the Dastur! Hurrah for the Union
and Progress Heroes! Come down to Beirut and
do some shouting with your fellow citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Letter V</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No; I do not approve of your idea of associating
with that young Mohammedan editor. You know
what is said about the tiger and its spots. Besides,
I had another offer from a Christian oldtimer; but
you might as well ask me to become a Jesuit as to
became a Journalist. I wrote last week a political
article, in which I criticised Majesty&#8217;s Address to
the Parliament, and mauled those oleaginous, palavering,
mealy-mouthed Representatives, who would
not dare point out the lies in it. They hear the Chief
Clerk read of &#8220;the efforts made by the Government
during the past thirty years in the interest of education,&#8221;
and applaud; while at the Royal Banquet they
jostle and hustle each other to kiss the edge of
Majesty&#8217;s frock-coat. The abject slaves!</p>
<p>The article was much quoted and commented upon;
I was flouted by many, defended by a few, these asked:
&#8220;Was the Government of Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid, committing
all its crimes in the interest of education, were we
being trained by the Censorship and the Bosphorus
Terror for the Dastur?&#8221; &#8220;But the person of
Majesty, the sacredness of the Khalifate,&#8221; cried the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
others. And a certain one, in the course of his attack,
denies the existence of Khalid, who died, said
he, a year ago. And what matters it if a dead man
can stir a whole city and blow into the nostrils of its
walking spectres a breath of life?</p>
<p>I spoke last night in one of the music halls and
gave the Mohammedans a piece of my mind. The
poor Christians!&ndash;&ndash;they feared the Government in the
old r&eacute;gime; they cower before the boatmen in this.
For the boatmen of Beirut have not lost their
prestige and power. They are a sort of commune
and are yet supreme. Yes, they are always riding
the whirlwind and directing the storm. And who
dares say a word against them? Every one of them,
in his swagger and bluster, is an Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid.
Alas, everything is yet in a chaotic state. The boatman&#8217;s
shriek can silence the Press and make the Spouters
tremble.</p>
<p>I am to lecture in the Public Hall of one of the
Colleges here on the &#8220;Moral Revolution.&#8221; Believe
me, I would not utter a word or write a line if I
were not impelled to it. And just as soon as some
one comes to the front to champion in this land spiritual
and moral freedom, I&#8217;ll go &#8220;way back and sit
down.&#8221; For why should I then give myself the
trouble? And the applause of the multitude, mind
you, brings me not a single olive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Letter XXII</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had made up my mind to go to Cairo, and I was
coming up to say farewell to you and mother. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
I like not Beirut, where one in winter must go
about in top-boots, and in a dust-coat in summer.
I wonder what Rousseau, who called Paris the city
of mud, would have said of this? Besides, a city
ruled by boatmen is not a city for gentlemen to live
in. So, I made up my mind to get out of it, and
quickly. But yesterday morning, before I had taken
my coffee, some one knocked at my door. I open,
and lo, a policeman in shabby uniform, makes inquiry
about Khalid. What have I done, I thought, to
deserve this visit? And before I had time to imagine
the worst, he delivers a card from the Deputy to
Syria of the Union and Progress Society of Salonique.
I am desired in this to come at my earliest convenience
to the Club to meet this gentleman. There, I
am received by an Army Officer and a certain Ahmed
Bey. And after the coffee and the formalities of civility
are over, I am asked to accompany them on a
tour to the principal cities of upper Syria&ndash;&ndash;to Damascus,
Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. The young
Army Officer is to speechify in Turkish, I, in Arabic,
and Ahmed Bey, who is as oleaginous as a Turk
could be, will take up, I think, the collection. Seeing
in this a chance to spread the Idea among our
people, I accept, and in a fortnight we shall be in
Damascus. You must come there, for I am burning
to meet and embrace you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Letter XXV</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whom do you think I met yesterday? Why,
nothing gave me greater pleasure ever since I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
been here than this: I was crossing the Square on
my way to the Club, when some one plucking at my
jubbah angrily greets me. I look back, and behold
our dear old Im-Hanna, who has just returned from
New York. She stood there waving her hand wildly
and rating me for not returning her salaam. &#8220;You
know no one any more, O Khalid,&#8221; she said plaintively;
&#8220;I call to you three times and you look not,
hear not. No matter, O Khalid.&#8221; Thereupon, she
embraces me as fondly as my mother. &#8220;And why,&#8221;
she inquired, &#8220;do you wear this black jubbah? Are
you now a monk? Were it not for that long hair
and that cap of yours, I would not have known you.
Let me see, isn&#8217;t that the cap I bought you in New
York?&#8221; And she takes it off my head to examine
it. &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. How good of you to keep it.
Well, how are you now? Do you cough any more?
Are you still crazy about books? I don&#8217;t think so,
for you have rosy cheeks now.&#8221; And sobbing for joy,
she embraces me again and again.</p>
<p>She is neatly dressed, wears a silk fich&eacute;, and is as
alert as ever. In the afternoon, I visit her at the
Hotel, and she asks me to accompany her to the Bank,
where she cashes three bills of exchange for three
hundred pounds each! I ask her what she is going
to do with all this money, and she tells me that she
is going to build a little home for her grandson and
send him to the College of the Americans here.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is there like America in all the world?&#8221; she
exclaims. &#8220;Ah, my heart for America!&#8221; And on
asking her why she did not remain there: &#8220;Fear not;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
just as soon as I build my house and place my son
in the College I am going back to New York. What,
O Khalid, will you return with me?&#8221; She then
takes some gold pieces in her hand, and lowering her
voice: &#8220;May be you need some money; take, take
these.&#8221; Dear old Im-Hanna, I would not refuse her
favour, and I would not accept one such. What was
I to do? Coming through the Jewellers&#8217; bazaar I
hit upon an idea, and with the money she slipped
into my pocket, I bought a gold watch in one of the
stores and charged her to present it to her grandson.
&#8220;Say it is from his brother, your other grandson
Khalid.&#8221; She protests, scolds, and finally takes the
watch, saying, &#8220;Well, nothing is changed in you: still
the same crazy Khalid.&#8221;</p>
<p>To-morrow she is coming to see my room, and to
cook for me a dish of <i>mojadderah</i>! Ah, the old days
in the cellar!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the thirtieth Letter, one of considerable length,
dated March, is an exceedingly titillating divagation
on the <i>gulma</i> (oustraation of <ins class="trchange" title="Added closing ')'">animals)</ins>, called forth, we
are told, &#8220;by the rut of the d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d cats in the
yard.&#8221; Poor Khalid can not sleep. One night he
jumps out of bed and chases them away with his
skillet, saying, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t I make such a row, ye
wantons?&#8221; They come again the following night,
and Khalid on the following morning moves to a
Hotel which, by good or ill chance, is adjacent to the
lupanars of the city. His window opens on another
yard in which other cats, alas!&ndash;&ndash;of the human species
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
this time&ndash;&ndash;are caterwauling, harrowing the soul of
him and the night. He makes a second remove, but
finds himself disturbed this time by the rut of a
certain roebuck within. Nature, O Khalid, will not
be cheated, no more than she will be abused, without
retaliating soon or late. True, you got out of many
ruts heretofore; but this you can not get out of except
you go deeper into it. Your anecdotes from Ad-Damiry
and your quotations from Montaigne shall
not help you. And your allusions to March-cats and
March-Khalids are too pitiful to be humorous. Indeed,
were not the tang of lubricity in this Letter too
strong, we would have given in full the confession
it contains.</p>
<p>We now come to the last of this Series, in which
Khalid speaks of a certain American lady, a Mrs.
Goodfree, or Gotfry, who is a votary of Ebbas Effendi,
the Pope of Babism at Heifa. Mrs. Gotfry
may not be a Babist in the strict sense of the word;
but she is a votary and worshipper of the Bab. To
her the personal element in a creed is of more importance
than the ism. Hence, her pilgrimage every
year to Heifa. She comes with presents and gold;
and Ebbas Effendi, who is not impervious to the influence
of other gods than his own, permits her into
the sanctuary, where she shares with him the light of
divine revelation and returns to the States, as the
Priestess of the Cult, to bless and console the Faithful.
Khalid was dining with Ahmed Bey at the
Grand Hotel&ndash;&ndash;but here is a portion of the Letter.</p>
<p>By a devilish mischance she occupied the seat opposite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
to mine. And in this trap of Iblis was decoy
enough for a poor mouse like me. It is an age since
I beheld such an Oriental gem in an American
setting; or such a strange Southern beauty in an
exotic frame. For one would think her from the
South, or further down from Mexico. Nay, of Andalusian,
and consequently of Arabian, origin she must
be. Her hair and her eyes are of the richest jet; her
glance, voluptuous, mysterious; her complexion,
neither white nor olive, but partakes of both,&ndash;&ndash;a
gauze-like shade of heliotrope, as it were, over a pink
and straw surface, if you can imagine that; and her
expression, a play between devotion and diabolism&ndash;&ndash;now
a question mark to love, now an exclamation
to sorrow, and at times a dash between both.
By what mysterious medium of romance and adventure
did America produce such a beauty, I can
not tell. Perhaps she, too, can not. If you saw her,
O Shakib, you&#8217;d do nothing for months but dedicate
odes to her eyes,&ndash;&ndash;to the deep, dark infinity of their
luring, devouring beauty,&ndash;&ndash;which seem to drop honey
and poison from every arched hair of their fulsome
lashes. Withal,&ndash;&ndash;another devilish mischance,&ndash;&ndash;she
was dressed in black and wore a white silk ruffle, like
myself. And her age? Well, she can not have
passed her sixth lustrum. And really, as the Novelist
would say in his Novel, she looks ten years younger....
To say we were attracted to each other
were presumptuous: but <i>I was</i> taken.... Near
her sat a Syrian gentleman of my acquaintance, with
whom she was conversing when we entered. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
is the lady whose beauty, when she was sitting, I described
to you: but when she got up to leave the table,&ndash;&ndash;alas,
and <i>ay me</i>, and all the other expressions of
regret and <ins class="trchange" title="Changed ',' to '.'">sorrow.</ins> That such a beautiful face should
be denied a corresponding beauty of figure. And
what is more pitiable about her, she is lame in the
right leg. Poor dear Misfortune, I wish it were in
my power to add an inch of my limb to hers.</p>
<p>And Khalid goes on limping, drooling, alassing, to
the end. After dinner he is introduced to his &#8220;poor
dear Misfortune&#8221; by his Syrian friend. But being
with Ahmed Bey he can not remain this evening. On
the following day, however, he is invited to lunch;
and on the terrace facing the sea, they pass the afternoon
discussing various subjects. Mrs. Gotfry is surprised
how a Syrian of Khalid&#8217;s mind can not see the
beauties of Babism, or Buhaism, as it is now called,
and the lofty spirituality of the Bab. But she forgives
him his lack of faith, gives him her card, and
invites him to her home, if he ever returns to the
United States.</p>
<p>Now, maugre the fact that, in a postscript to this
Letter, Khalid closes with these words, &#8220;And what
have I to do with priests and priestesses?&#8221; we can not
but harbour a suspicion that his &#8220;Union and Progress&#8221;
tour is bound to have more than a political
significance. By ill or good hap those words are
beginning to assume a double meaning; and maugre
all efforts to the contrary, the days must soon unfold
the twofold tendency and result of the &#8220;Union and
Progress&#8221; ideas of Khalid.</p>

In some parts of Syria, as in Arabia, almost every ill and
affection is attributed to the rheums, or called so. Rheumatism,
for instance, is explained by the Arab quack as a defluxion
of rheums, failing to discharge through the upper
orifices, progress downward, and settling in the muscles and
joints, produce the affection. And might there not be more
truth in that than the diagnosis of him who is a Membre de

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>REVOLUTIONS WITHIN AND WITHOUT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Even Carlyle can be longwinded and short-sighted
on occasions. &#8216;Once in destroying the
False,&#8217; says he, &#8216;there was a certain inspiration.&#8217;
And always there is, to be sure, my Master. For
the world is not Europe, and the final decision on
Who Is and What Is To Rule, was not delivered
by the French Revolution. The Orient, the land of
origination and prophecy, must yet solve for itself
this eternal problem of the Old and New, the False
and True. And whether by Revolutions, Speculations,
or Constitutions, ancient Revelation will be
purged and restored to its original pristine purity:
the superannuated lumber that accumulated around
it during centuries of apathy, fatalism, and sloth, must
go: the dust and mould and cobwebs of the Temple
will be swept away. Indeed, &#8216;a war must be
eternally waged on evils eternally renewed.&#8217; The
genius of destruction has done its work, you say, O
my esteemed Master? and there is nothing more to
destroy? The gods might say this of other worlds
than ours. In Europe, as in Asia, there is to be
considered and remembered: if this mass of things
we call humanity and civilisation were as healthy as
the eternal powers would have them, the healthiest of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
the race would not be constantly studying and dissecting
our social and political ills.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a certain sense, we are healthier to-day than
the Europeans; but our health is that of the slave and
not the master: it is of more benefit to others than
it is to ourselves. We are doomed to be the drudges
of neurasthenic, psychopathic, egoistic masters, if we
do not open our minds to the light of science and
truth. &#8216;Every age has its Book,&#8217; says the Prophet.
But every book, if it aspires to be a guide to life, must
contain of the eternal truth what was in the one that
preceded it. We can not afford to let aught of this
die. Leave the principal original altar in the Temple,
and destroy all the others. Light on that altar the
torch of science, which the better mind and cleaner
hand of Europe are transmitting to us, and place your
foot upon its false and unspeakable divinities. The
gods of wealth, of egoism, of alcohol, of fornication,
we must not acknowledge; nay, we must resist unto
death their malign influence and power. But alas,
what are we doing to-day? Instead of looking up to
the pure and lofty souls of Europe for guidance, we
welter in the mud with the lowest and most degenerate.
We are beginning to know and appreciate
English whiskey, but not English freedom; we know
the French grisettes, but not the French sages; we
guzzle German beer, but of German wisdom we
taste not a drop.</p>
<p>&#8220;O my Brothers, let us cease rejoicing in the
Dastur; for at heart we know no freedom, nor truth,
nor order. We elect our representatives to Parliament,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
but not unlike the Europeans; we borrow from
France what the deeper and higher mind of France no
longer believes; we imitate England in what England
has long since discarded; but our Books of Revelation,
which made France and Germany and England what
they are, and in which is the divine essence of truth
and right and freedom, we do not rightly understand.
A thousand falsehoods are cluttered around the truth
to conceal it from us. I call you back, O my
Brothers, to the good old virtues of our ancestors.
Without these the Revolution will miscarry and our
Dastur will not be worth a date-stone. Our ancestors,&ndash;&ndash;they
never bowed their proud neck to tyranny,
whether represented in an autocrat or in a body of
autocrats; they never betrayed their friends; they
never soiled their fingers with the coin of usury; they
never sacrificed their manhood to fashion; they never
endangered in the caf&eacute;s and lupanars their health and
reason. The Mosque and the Church, notwithstanding
the ignorance and bigotry they foster, are still better
than lunatic asylums. And Europe can not have
enough of these to-day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continence, purity of heart, fidelity, simplicity, a
sense of true manhood, magnanimity of spirit, a healthiness
of body and mind,&ndash;&ndash;these are the beautiful ancient
virtues. These are the supreme truths of the
Books of Revelation: in these consists the lofty spirituality
of the Orient. But through what thick, obscene
growths we must pass to-day, through what cactus
hedges and thistle-fields we must penetrate, before we
rise again to those heights.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There can be no Revolution without a Reformation,&#8217;
says a German philosopher. And truly so. For
the fetters which bind us can not be shaken off, before
the conscience is emancipated. A political revolution
must always be preceded by a spiritual one, that it
might have some enduring effect. Otherwise, things
will revert to their previous state of rottenness as sure
as Allah lives. But mind you, I do not say, Cut down
the hedges; mow the thistle-fields; uproot the obscene
plants; no: I only ask you to go through them, and
out of them, to return no more. Sell your little estate
there, if you have one; sell it at any price: give it
away and let the dead bury their dead. Cease to work
in those thorny fields, and God and nature will do the
rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am for a reformation by emigration. And
quietly, peacefully, this can be done. Nor fire, nor
sword bring I: only this I say: Will and do; resolve
and act upon your resolution. The emigration of
the mind before the revolution of the state, my Brothers.
The soul must be free, and the mind, before
one has a right to be a member of a free Government,
before one can justly enjoy his rights and perform his
duties as a subject. But a voting slave, O my Brothers,
is the pitifulest spectacle under the sun. And remember
that neither the Dastur, nor the Unionists, nor
the Press, can give you this spiritual freedom, if you do
not awake and emigrate. Come up to the highlands:
here is a patrimony for each of you; here are vineyards
to cultivate. Leave the thistle-fields and marshes behind;
regret nothing. Come out of the superstitions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
of the sheikhs and ulema; of the barren mazes of the
sufis; of the deadly swamps of theolougues and priests:
emigrate! Every one of us should be a Niazi in this
moral struggle, an Enver in this spiritual revolution.
A little will-power, a little heroism, added to those virtues
I have named, the solid virtues of our ancestors,
and the Orient will no longer be an object of scorn
and gain to commercial Europe. We shall then stand
on an equal footing with the Europeans. Ay, with the
legacy of science which we shall learn to invest, and
with our spirituality divested of its cobwebs, and purified,
we shall stand even higher than the Americans
and Europeans.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>On the following day Damascus was simmering
with excitement&ndash;&ndash;Damascus, the stronghold of the
ulema&ndash;&ndash;the learned fanatics&ndash;&ndash;whom Khalid has
lightly pinched. But they scarcely felt it; they could
not believe it. Now, the gentry of Islam, the sheikhs
and ulema, would hear this lack-beard dervish, as he
was called. But they disdain to stand with the rabble
in the Midan or congregate with the <i>Mutafarnejin</i>
(Europeanised) in the public Halls. Nowhere but
at the Mosque, therefore, can they hear what this
Khalid has to say. This was accordingly decided
upon, and, being approved by all parties concerned,&ndash;&ndash;the
Mufti, the Vali, the Deputies of the Holy Society
and the speaker,&ndash;&ndash;a day was set for the great address
at the great Mosque of Omaiyah.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the blatant Officer, the wheedling
Politician, and the lack-beard Dervish, are feasted by
the personages and functionaries of Damascus. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
Vali, the Mufti, Abdallah Pasha,&ndash;&ndash;he who owns
more than two score villages and has more than five
thousand braves at his beck and call,&ndash;&ndash;these, and
others of less standing, vie with each other in honouring
the distinguished visitors. And after the banqueting,
while Ahmed Bey retires to a private room
with his host to discuss the political situation, Khalid,
to escape the torturing curiosity of the bores and
quidnuncs of the evening, goes out to the open court,
and under an orange tree, around the gurgling fountain,
breathes again of quietude and peace. Nay,
breathes deeply of the heavy perfume of the white
jasmines of his country, while musing of the scarlet
salvias of a distant land.</p>
<p>And what if the salvia, as by a miracle, blossoms
on the jasmine? What if the former stifles the latter?
Indeed, one can escape boredom, but not love.
One can flee the quidnuncs of the salon, but not the
questioning perplexity of one&#8217;s heart. A truce now
to ambiguities.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis high time that we give a brief account of what
took place after Khalid took leave of Mrs. Gotfry.
Many &#8220;devilish mischances&#8221; have since then conspired
against Khalid&#8217;s peace of mind. For when
they were leaving Beirut, only a few minutes before
the train started, Mrs. Gotfry, who was also going to
Damascus, steps into the same carriage, which he and
his companions occupied: mischance first. Arriving
in Damascus they both stay at the same Hotel: mischance
second. At table this time he occupies the seat
next to hers, and once, rising simultaneously, their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
limbs touch: mischance third. And the last and
worst, when he retires to his room, he finds that her
own is in the same side-hall opposite to his. Now, who
could have ordered it thus, of all the earthly powers?
And who can say what so many mischances might not
produce? True, a thousand thistles do not make a
rose; but with destiny this logic does not hold. For
every new mischance makes us forget the one preceding;
and the last and worst is bound to be the harbinger
of good fortune. Yes, every people, we
imagine, has its aphorisms on the subject: Distress is
the key of relief, says the Arabic proverb; The strait
leads to the plain, says the Chinese; The darkest hour
is nearest the dawn, says the English.</p>
<p>But we must not make any stipulations with time,
or trust in aphorisms. We do not know what Mrs.
Gotfry&#8217;s ideas are on the subject. Nor can we say
how she felt in the face of these strange coincidences.
In her religious heart, might there not be some shadow
of an ancient superstition, some mystical, instinctive
strain, in which the preternatural is resolved? That
is a question which neither our Scribe nor his Master
will help us to answer. And we, having been faithful
so far in the discharge of our editorial duty, can
not at this juncture afford to fabricate.</p>
<p>We know, however, that the Priestess of Buhaism
and the beardless, long-haired Dervish have many a
conversation together: in the train, in the Hotel, in
the parks and groves of Damascus, they tap their
hearts and minds, and drink of each other&#8217;s wine of
thought and fancy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I first mistook you for a Mohammedan,&#8221; she said
to him once; and he assured her that she was not mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, you are not a Christian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a Christian, <ins class="trchange" title="Added closing double-quote">too.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>And he relates of the Buha when he was on trial
in Rhodes. &#8220;Of what religion are you,&#8221; asks the
Judge. &#8220;I am neither a Camel-driver nor a Carpenter,&#8221;
replies the Buha, alluding thereby to Mohammad
and Christ. &#8220;If you ask me the same question,&#8221;
Khalid continues&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;but I see you are uncomfortable.&#8221;
And he takes up the cushion which had fallen
behind the divan, and places it under her arm. He
then lights a cigarette and holds it up to her inquiringly.
Yes? He, therefore, lights another for himself,
and continues. &#8220;If you ask me the same question
that was asked the Buha, I would not hesitate in
saying that I am both a Camel-driver and Carpenter.
I might also be a Buhaist in a certain sense. I renounce
falsehood, whatsoever be the guise it assumes;
and I embrace truth, wheresoever I find it. Indeed,
every religion is good and true, if it serves the high
purpose of its founder. And they are false, all of
them, when they serve the low purpose of their high
priests. Take the lowest of the Arab tribes, for instance,
and you will find in their truculent spirit a
strain of faith sublime, though it is only evinced at
times. The Beduins, rovers and raveners, manslayers
and thieves, are in their house of moe-hair the kindest
hosts, the noblest and most generous of men.
They receive the wayfarer, though he be an enemy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
and he eats and drinks and sleeps with them under
the same root, in the assurance of Allah. If a religion
makes a savage so good, so kind, it has well
served its purpose. As for me, I admire the grand
passion in both the Camel-driver and the Carpenter:
the barbaric grandeur, the magnanimity and fidelity
of the Arab as well as the sublime spirituality, the
divine beauty, of the Nazarene, I deeply reverence.
And in one sense, the one is the complement of the
other: the two combined are <i>my</i> ideal of a Divinity.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now we descend from the chariot of the
empyrean where we are riding with gods and apostles,
and enter into one drawn by mortal coursers. We go
out for a drive, and alight from the carriage in the
poplar grove, to meander in its shades, along its streams.
But digressing from one path into another, we enter
unaware the eternal vista of love. There, on a
boulder washed by the murmuring current, in the
shade of the silver-tufted poplars, Khalid and Mrs.
Gotfry sit down for a rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything in life must always resolve itself into
love,&#8221; said Khalid, as he stood on the rock holding out
his hand to his friend. &#8220;Love is the divine solvent.
Love is the splendour of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gotfry paused at the last words. She was
startled by this image. Love, the splendour of God?
Why, the Bab, the Buha, is the splendour of God.
Buha mean splendour. The Buha, therefore, is love.
Love is the new religion. It is the old religion, the
eternal religion, the only religion. How came he by
this, this young Syrian? Would he rival the Buha?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
Rise above him? They are of kindred races&ndash;&ndash;their
ancestors, too, may be mine. Love the splendour of
God&ndash;&ndash;God the splendour of Love. Have I been
all along fooling myself? Did I not know my own
heart?</p>
<p>These, and more such, passed through Mrs. Gotfry&#8217;s
mind, as shuttles through a loom, while Khalid
was helping her up to her seat on the boulder, which
is washed by the murmuring current.</p>
<p>&#8220;If life were such a rock under our feet,&#8221; said he,
pressing his lips upon her hand, &#8220;the divine currents
around it will melt it, soon or late, into love.&#8221;</p>
<p>They light cigarettes. A fresh breeze is blowing
from the city. It is following them with the perfume
of its gardens. The falling leaves are whispering
in the grove to the swaying boughs. The narcissus
is nodding to the myrtle across the way. And
the bulbuls are pouring their golden splendour of
song. Khalid speaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beauty either detains, repels, or enchants. The
first is purely external, linear; the second is an imitation
of the first, its artistic artificial ideal, so to speak;
and the third&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;He is silent. His eyes, gazing into
hers, take up the cue.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gotfry turns from him exhausted. She looks
into the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;See the rose-beds in the stream; see the lovely
pebbles dancing around them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see everything in your eyes, which are like
limpid lakes shaded with weeping-willows. I can
even hear bulbuls singing in your brows.&ndash;&ndash;Turn not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
from me your eyes. They reflect the pearls of your
soul and the flowers of your body, even as those
crystal waters reflect the pebbles and rose-beds beneath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not say that love is the splendour of
God?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, why look for it in my eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why look for it in the heart of the heavens,
in the depths of the sea&ndash;&ndash;in the infinities of everything
that is beautiful and terrible&ndash;&ndash;in the breath
of that little flower, in the song of the bulbul, in the
whispers of your silken lashes, in&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut your eyes, Khalid; be more spiritual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With my eyes open I see but one face; with my
eyes closed I see a million faces: they are all yours.
And they are loving, and sweet, and kind. But I am
content with one, with the carnate symbol of them,
with you, and though you be cold and cruel. The
divine splendour is here, and here and here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, your ardour is exhausting.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>But on their way back to the Hotel, Khalid gives
her this from Swedenborg: &#8220;&#8216;Do you love me&#8217; means
&#8216;do you see the same truth that I see?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no use. Khalid is impossible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A DREAM OF EMPIRE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not starving for pleasure,&#8221; Khalid once said
to Shakib; &#8220;nor for the light free love of an
exquisite caprice. Those little flowers that bloom and
wither in the blush of dawn are for the little butterflies.
The love that endures, give me that. And it
must be of the deepest divine strain,&ndash;&ndash;as deep and
divine as maternal love. Man is of Eternity, not of
Time; and love, the highest attribute of man, must
be likewise. With me it must endure throughout all
worlds and immensities; else I would not raise a
finger for it. Pleasure, Shakib, is for the child within
us; sexual joy, for the animal; love, for the god.
That is why I say when you set your seal to the contract,
be sure it is of the kind which all the gods of
all the future worlds will raise to their lips in reverence.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Khalid&#8217;s child-spirit, not to say childishness, is
not, as he would have us believe, a thing of the past.
Nor are the animal and the god within him always
agreed as to what is and what is not a love divine and
eternal. In New York, to be sure, he often brushed
his wings against those flowerets that &#8220;bloom and
wither in the blush of dawn.&#8221; And he was not a
little pleased to find that the dust which gathers on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
the wings adds a charm to the colouring of life. But
how false and trivial it was, after all. The gold dust
and the dust of the road, could they withstand a drop
of rain? A love dust-deep, as it were, close to the
earth; too mean and pitiful to be carried by the storm
over terrible abysses to glorious heights. A love, in
a word, without pain, that is to say impure. In
Baalbek, on the other hand, he drank deep of the pain,
but not of the joy, of love. He and his cousin
Najma had just lit in the shrine of Venus the candles
of the altar of the Virgin, when a villainous hand that
of Jesuitry, issuing from the darkness, clapped over
them the snuffer and carried his Happiness off. Here
was a love divine, the promised bliss of which was
snatched away from him.</p>
<p>And now in Damascus, he feels, for the first time,
the exquisite pain and joy of a love which he can not
yet fathom; a love, which like the storm, is carrying
him over terrible abysses to unknown heights. The
bitter sting of a Nay he never felt so keenly before.
The sleep-stifling torture and joy of suspense he did
not fully experience until now. But if he can not
sleep, he will work. He has but a few days to prepare
his address. He can not be too careful of what
he says, and how he says it. To speak at the great
Mosque of Omaiyah is a great privilege. A word
uttered there will reach the furthermost parts of the
Mohammedan world. Moreover, all the ulema and
all the heavy-turbaned fanatics will be there.</p>
<p>But he can not even work. On the table before
him is a pile of newspapers from all parts of Syria
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
and Egypt&ndash;&ndash;even from India&ndash;&ndash;and all simmering,
as it were, with Khalid&#8217;s name, and Khalidism, and
Khalid scandals. He is hailed by some, assailed by
others; glorified and vilified in tawdry rhyme and
ponderous prose by Christians and Mohammedans
alike. &#8220;Our new Muhdi,&#8221; wrote an Egyptian wit
(one of those pallid prosers we once met in the
hasheesh dens, no doubt), &#8220;our new Muhdi has
added to his hareem an American beauty with an
Oriental leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>What he meant by this only the hasheesh smokers
know. &#8220;An instrument in the hands of some
American speculators, who would build sky-scrapers
on the ruins of our mosques,&#8221; wrote another.
&#8220;A lever with which England is undermining Al-Islam,&#8221;
cried a voice in India. &#8220;A base one in the
service of some European coalition, who, under the
pretext of preaching the spiritualities, is undoing the
work of the Revolution. The gibbet is for ordinary
traitors; for him the stake,&#8221; etc., etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he is hailed as the expected
one,&ndash;&ndash;the true leader, the real emancipator,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;who
has in him the soul of the East and the mind of the
West, the builder of a great Asiatic Empire.&#8221; Of
course, the foolish Damascene editor who wrote this
had to flee the country the following day. But
Khalid&#8217;s eyes lingered on that line. He read it and
reread it over and over again&ndash;&ndash;forward and backward,
too. He juggled, so to speak, with its words.</p>
<p>How often people put us, though unwittingly, on
the path we are seeking, he thought. How often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
does a chance word uttered by a stranger reveal to us
our deepest aims and purposes.</p>
<p>Before him was ink and paper. He took up the
pen. But after scrawling and scribbling for ten
minutes, the sheet was filled with circles and arabesques,
and the one single word Dowla (Empire).</p>
<p>He could not think: he could only dream. The
soul of the East&ndash;&ndash;The mind of the West&ndash;&ndash;the
builder of a great Empire. The triumph of the Idea,
the realisation of a great dream: the rise of a great
race who has fallen on evil days; the renaissance of
Arabia; the reclaiming of her land; the resuscitation
of her glory;&ndash;&ndash;and why not? especially if backed
with American millions and the love of a great
woman. He is enraptured. He can neither sleep
nor think: he can but dream. He puts on his jubbah,
refills his cigarette box, and walks out of his room.
He paces up and down the hall, crowning his dream
with wreaths of smoke. But the dim lights seemed
to be ogling each other and smiling, as he passed.
The clocks seemed to be casting pebbles at him. The
silence horrified him. He pauses before a door. He
knocks&ndash;&ndash;knocks again.</p>
<p>The occupant of that room was not yet asleep. In
fact, she, too, could not sleep. The clock in the hall
outside had just struck one, and she was yet reading.
After inquiring who it was that knocked, she puts on
a kimono and opens the door. She is surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything the matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I can not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is amusing. And do you take me for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
soporific? If you think you can sleep here, stretch
yourself on the couch and try.&#8221; Saying which, she
laughed and hurried back to her bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not come to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then? How lovely of you to wake me up
so early.&ndash;&ndash;No, no; don&#8217;t apologise. For truly, I
too, could not sleep. You see, I was still reading.
Sit on the couch there and talk to me.&ndash;&ndash;Of course,
you may smoke.&ndash;&ndash;No, I prefer to sit in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khalid lights another cigarette and sits down. On
the table before him are some antique colour prints
which Mrs. Gotfry had bought in the Bazaar. These
one can only get in Damascus. And&ndash;&ndash;strange coincidence!&ndash;&ndash;they
represented some of the heroes of
Arabia&ndash;&ndash;Antar, Ali, Saladin, Har&ucirc;n ar-Rashid&ndash;&ndash;done
in gorgeous colouring, and in that deliciously
ludicrous angular style which is neither Arabic nor
Egyptian, but a combination perhaps of both. Khalid
reads the poetry under each of them and translates
it into English. Mrs. Gotfry is charmed. Khalid
is lost in thought. He lays the picture of Saladin on
the table, lights another cigarette, looks intently upon
his friend, his face beaming with his dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamilah.&#8221; It was the first time he called her by
her first name&ndash;&ndash;an Arabic name which, as a Bahaist
she had adopted. And she was neither surprised nor
displeased.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need another Saladin to-day,&ndash;&ndash;a Saladin of
the Idea, who will wage a crusade, not against
Christianity or Mohammedanism, but against those
Tataric usurpers who are now toadying to both.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean the Turks. They were given a last
chance to rise; they tried and failed. They can not
rise. They are demoralised; they have no stamina,
no character; no inborn love for truth and art; no
instinctive or acquired sense of right and justice.
Whiskey and debauch and high-sounding inanities
about fraternity and equality can not regenerate an
Empire. The Turk must go: he will go. But out
in those deserts is a race which is always young, a race
that never withers; a strong, healthy, keen-eyed,
quick-witted race; a fighting, fanatical race; a race
that gave Europe a civilisation, that gave the world
a religion; a race with a past as glorious as Rome&#8217;s;
and with a future, too, if we had an Ali or a Saladin.
But He who made those heroes will make others like
them, better, too. He may have made one already,
and that one may be wandering now in the desert.
Now think what can be done in Arabia, think what
the Arabs can accomplish, if American arms and an
up-to-date Kor&acirc;n are spread broadcast among them.
With my words and your love and influence, with our
powers united, we can build an Arab Empire, we can
resuscitate the Arab Empire of the past. Abd&#8217;ul-Wahhab,
you know, is the Luther of Arabia; and
Wahhabism is not dead. It is only slumbering in
Nejd. We will wake it; arm it; infuse into it the
living spirit of the Idea. We will begin by building
a plant for the manufacture of arms on the shore of
the Euphrates, and a University in Yaman. The
Turk must go&ndash;&ndash;at least out of Arabia. And the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
Turk in Europe, Europe will look after. No; the
Arab will never be virtually conquered. Nominally,
maybe. And I doubt if any of the European Powers
can do it. Why? Chiefly because Arabia has a
Prophet. She produced one and she will produce
more. Cannons can destroy Empires; but only the
living voice, the inspired voice can build them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gotfry is silent. In Khalid&#8217;s vagaries is a
big idea, which she can not wholly grasp. And she
is moreover devoted to another cause&ndash;&ndash;the light of
the world&ndash;&ndash;the splendour of God&ndash;&ndash;Buhaism. But
why not spread it in Arabia as in America? She will
talk to Ebbas Effendi about Khalid. He is young,
eloquent, rising to power. And with her love, and
influence superadded, what might he not do? what
might he not accomplish? These ideas flashed
through her mind, while Khalid was pacing up and
down the room, which was already filled with smoke.
She is absorbed in thought. Khalid comes near her
bed, bends over her, and buries his face in her wealth
of black hair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gotfry is startled as from a dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not see all that you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do not love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that? Here, now go sit down.
Oh, I am suffocating. The smoke is so thick in the
room I can scarcely see you. And it is so late.&ndash;&ndash;No,
no. Give me time to think on the subject. Now,
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Gotfry opens the door and the window
to let out Khalid and his smoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go, Khalid, and try to sleep. And if you can
not sleep, try to write. And if you can not write,
read. And if you can neither read nor write nor
sleep, why, then, put on your shoes and go out for a
walk. Good night. There. Good night. But don&#8217;t
forget, we must visit Sheikh Taleb to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The astute Mrs. Gotfry might have added, And if
you do not feel like walking, take a dip in the River
Barada. But in her words, to be sure, were a
douche cold enough for Khalid. Now, to be just and
comprehensive in our History we must record here
that she, too, did not, and could not sleep that night.
The thought that Khalid would make a good apostle
of Buhaism and incidentally a good companion, insinuated
itself between the lines on every page of the
book she was trying to read.</p>
<p>On the following day they visit Sheikh Taleb, who
is introduced to us by Shakib in these words:</p>
<p>&#8220;A Muslem, like Socrates, who educates not by lesson,
but by going about his business. He seldom deigns
to write; and yet, his words are quoted by every writer
of the day, and on every subject sacred and profane.
His good is truly magnetic. He is a man who lives
after his own mind and in his own robes; an Arab
who prays after no Imam, but directly to Allah and
his Apostle; a scholar who has more dryasdust knowledge
on his finger ends than all the ulema of Cairo
and Damascus; a philosopher who would not give an
orange peel for the opinion of the world; an ascetic
who flees celebrity as he would the plague; a sage
who does not disdain to be a pedagogue; an eccentric
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
withal to amuse even a Diogenes:&ndash;&ndash;this is the noted
Sheikh Taleb of Damascus, whom Mrs. Gotfry once
met at Ebbas Effendy&#8217;s in Akka, and whom she was
desirous of meeting again. When we first went to
visit him, this charming lady and Khalid and I, we
had to knock at the door until his neighbour peered
from one of the windows above and told us that the
Sheikh is asleep, and that if we would see him, we
must come in the evening. I learned afterwards that
he, reversing the habitual practice of mankind, works
at night and sleeps during the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We return in the evening. And the Sheikh, with
a lamp in his hand, peers through a small square opening
in the door to see who is knocking. He knew
neither Khalid nor myself; but Mrs. Gotfry&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Eigh!&#8217;
he mused. And as he beheld her face in
the lamplight he exclaimed &#8216;Marhaba (welcome)!
Marhaba!&#8217; and hastened to unbolt the door. We
are shown through a dark, narrow hall, into a small
court, up to his study. Which is a three-walled
room&ndash;&ndash;a sort of stage&ndash;&ndash;opening on the court, and
innocent of a divan or a settle or a chair. While he
and Mrs. Gotfry were exchanging greetings in Persian,
I was wondering why in Damascus, the city of
seven rivers and of poetry and song, should there be a
court guilty like this one of a dry and dilapidated
fountain. I learned afterwards, however, that the
Sheikh can not tolerate the noise of the water; and
so, suffering from thirst and neglect, the fountain
goes to ruin.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the stage, which is the study, is a clutter of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
old books and pamphlets; in the corner is the usual
straw mat, a cushion, and a sort of stool on which
are ink and paper. This he clears, places the cushion
upon it, and offers to Mrs. Gotfry; he himself sits
down on the mat; and we are invited to arrange for
ourselves some books. Indeed, the Sheikh is right;
most of these tomes are good for nothing else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gotfry introduces us.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah, but thou art young and short of stature,&#8217; said
he to Khalid; &#8216;that is ominous. Verily, there is
danger in thy path.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But he will embrace Buhaism,&#8217; put in Mrs. Gotfry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That might save him. Buhaism is the old torch,
relighted after many centuries, by Allah.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile Khalid was thinking of second-hand
Jerry of the second-hand book-shop of New York.
The Sheikh reminded him of his old friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was holding in my hand a book on which
I chanced while arranging my seat. It was Debrett&#8217;s
Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage. How did
such a book find its way into the Sheikh&#8217;s rubbish,
I wondered. But birds of a feather, thought I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That book was sent to me,&#8217; said he, &#8216;by a merchant
friend, who found it in the Bazaar. They send
me all kinds of books, these simple of heart. They
think I can read in all languages and discourse on all
subjects. Allah forgive them.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I tell him, in reply to his inquiry, that
the book treats of Titles, Orders, and Degrees of Precedence,
he utters a sharp whew, and with a quick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
gesture of weariness and disgust, tells me to take it.
&#8216;I have my head full of our own ansab (pedigrees),&#8217;
he adds, &#8216;and I have no more respect for a green turban
(the colour of the Muslem nobility) than I have
for this one,&#8217; pointing to his, which is white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gotfry then asks the Sheikh what he thinks
of Wahhabism.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is Islam in its pristine purity; it is the Islam
of the first great Khalifs. &#8220;Mohammed is dead; but
Allah lives,&#8221; said Abu Bekr to the people on the death
of the Prophet. And Wahhabism is a direct telegraph
wire between mortal man and his God.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But why should these Wahhabis of Nejd be the
most fanatical, when their doctrines are the most
pure?&#8217; asked Khalid.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In thy question is the answer to it. They are
fanatical <i>because</i> of their purity of doctrine, and
withal because they live in Nejd. If there were a
Wahhabi sect in Barr&#8217;ush-Sham (Syria), it would not
be thus, assure thee.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And expressing his liking for Khalid, he advises
him to be careful of his utterances in Damascus, if he
believes in self-preservation. &#8216;I am old,&#8217; he continues;
&#8216;and the ulema do not think my flesh is good
for sacrifice. But thou art young, and plump&ndash;&ndash;a
tender yearling&ndash;&ndash;ah, be careful sheikh Khalid.
Then, I do not talk to the people direct. I talk to
them through holy men and dervishes. The people
do not believe in a philosopher; but the holy man, and
though he attack the most sacred precepts of the
Faith, they will believe. And Damascus is the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
hive of turbans, green and otherwise. So guard thee,
my child.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gotfry then asks for a minute&#8217;s privacy with
the Sheikh. And before he withdraws with her to the
court, he searches through a heap of mouldy tomes,
draws from beneath them a few yellow pamphlets on
the Comparative Study of the Semetic Alphabets and
on The Rights of the Khalifate&ndash;&ndash;such is the scope of
his learning&ndash;&ndash;and dusting these on his knee, presents
them to us, saying, &#8216;Judge us not severely.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not mean that he cares much if we do
or not. But in our country, in the Orient, even a
Diogenes does not disdain to handle the coin of affability.
We are always meekly asked, even by the most
supercilious, to overlook shortcomings, and condone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not in passing out, however, overlook
the string of orange peels which hung on a pole in the
court. Nor am I sensible of an indecorum if I give
out that the Sheikh lives on oranges, and preserves
the peels for kindling the fire. And this, his only
article of food, he buys at wholesale, like his robes
and undergarments. For he never changes or washes
anything. A robe is worn continually, worn out in
the run, and discarded. He no more believes in the
efficacy of soap than in the efficacy of a good reputation.
&#8216;The good opinion of men,&#8217; he says, &#8216;does not
wash our hearts and minds. And if these be clean,
all&#8217;s clean.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why, I think, he struck once with his staff
a journalist for inserting in his paper a laudatory notice
on the Sheikh&#8217;s system of living and thinking and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
speaking of him as &#8216;a deep ocean of learning and wisdom.&#8217;
Even in travelling he carries nothing with
him but his staff, that he might the quicker flee, or
put to flight, the vulgar curious. He puts on a few
extra robes, when he is going on a journey, and in
time, becoming threadbare, sheds them off as the serpent
its skin....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And we pity our Scribe if he ever goes back to
Damascus after this, and the good Sheikh chances upon
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>ADUMBRATIONS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;In the morning of the eventful day,&#8221; it is set
forth in the <i>Histoire Intime</i>, &#8220;I was in Khalid&#8217;s
room writing a letter, when Ahmed Bey comes
in to confer with him. They remain together for
some while during which I could hear Khalid growl
and Ahmed Bey gently whispering, &#8216;But the Dastur,
the Unionists, Mother Society,&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;this being the burden
of his song. When he leaves, Khalid, with a
scowl on his brow, paces up and down the room,
saying, &#8216;They would treat me like a school boy; they
would have me speak by rule, and according to their
own dictation. They even espy my words and actions
as if I were an enemy of the Constitution. No;
let them find another. The servile spouters in the
land are as plenty as summer flies. After I deliver
my address to-day, Shakib, we will take the first train
for Baalbek. I want to see my mother. No, billah!
I can not go any further with these Turks.
Why, read this.&#8217; And he hands me the memorandum,
or outline of the speech given to him by Ahmed
Bey.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this, we learn, is a litany of praises, beginning
with Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid and ending with the ulema of
Damascus; which litany the Society Deputies would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
place in the mouth of Khalid for the good of all concerned.
Ay, for his good, too, if he but knew. If
he but looked behind him, he would have yielded a
whit, this Khalid. The deep chasm between him and
the Deputy, however, justifies the conduct of each on
his side: the lack of gumption in the one and the lack
of depth in the other render impossible any sort of
understanding between them. While we recommend,
therefore, the prudence of the oleaginous Ahmed, we
can not with justice condemn the perversity of our
fretful Khalid. For he who makes loud boast of
spiritual freedom, is, nevertheless, a slave of the Idea.
And slavery in some shape or shade will clutch at
the heart of the most powerful and most developed
of mortals. Poor Khalid! if Truth commands thee
to destroy the memorandum of Ahmed Bey, Wisdom
suggests that thou destroy, too, thine address. And
Wisdom in the person of Sheikh Taleb now knocks
at thy door.</p>
<p>The Sheikh is come to admonish Khalid, not to
return his visit. For at this hour of the day he
should have been a-bed; but his esteem for Mrs. Gotfry,
billah, his love, too, for her friend Khalid, and
his desire to avert a possible danger, banish sleep from
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;My spirit is perturbed about thee,&#8221; thus further,
&#8220;and I can not feel at ease until I have given my
friendly counsel. Thou art free to follow it or not
to follow it. But for the sake of this beard Sheikh
Khalid, do not speak at the Mosque to-day. I know
the people of this City: they are ignorant, obtuse, fanatical,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
blind. &#8216;God hath sealed up their hearts and
their hearing.&#8217; They will not hear thee; they can not
understand thee. I know them better than thou: I
have lived amongst them for forty years. And what
talk have we wasted. They will not hear; they can
not see. It&#8217;s a dog&#8217;s tail, Sheikh Khalid. And what
Allah hath twisted, man can not straighten. So, let
it be. Let them wallow in their ignorance. Or, if
thou wilt help them, talk not to them direct. Use
the medium of the holy man, like myself. This is
my advice to thee. For thine own sake and for the
sake of that good woman, thy friend and mine, I give
it. Now, I can go and sleep. Salaam.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the grey beard of Sheikh Taleb and his sharp
blue eyes were animated, as he spoke, agitated like his
spirit. What he has heard abroad and what he suspects,
are shadowed forth in his friendly counsel. Let
Khalid reflect upon it. Our Scribe, at least, is persuaded
that Sheikh Taleb spoke as a friend. And he,
too, suspects that something is brewing abroad. He
would have Khalid hearken, therefore, to the Sheikh.</p>
<p>But Khalid in silence ponders the matter. And at
table, even Mrs. Gotfry can not induce him to
speak. She has just returned from the bazaar;
she could hardly make her way through the choked
arcade leading to the Mosque; the crowd is immense
and tumultuous; and a company of the Dragoons is
gone forth to open the way and maintain order.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think they are going to succeed,&#8221; she
added. Silently, impassively, Khalid hears this.
And after going through the second course, eating as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
if he were dreaming, he gets up and leaves the table.
Mrs. Gotfry, somewhat concerned, orders her last
course, takes her thimble-full of coffee at a gulp, and,
leaving likewise, hurries upstairs and calls Khalid,
who was pacing up and down the hall, into her room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing,&#8221; murmured Khalid absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. Everything belies your words.
Why, your actions, your expression, your silence oppresses
me. I know what is disturbing you. And I
would prevail upon you, if I could, to give up this
afternoon&#8217;s business. Don&#8217;t go; don&#8217;t speak. I have
a premonition that things are not going to end well.
Why, even my dragoman says that the Mohammedan
mob is intent upon some evil business. Be advised.
And since you are going to break with your associates,
why not do so now. The quicker the better. Come,
make up your mind. And we&#8217;ll not wait for the
morning train. We&#8217;ll leave for Baalbek in a special
carriage this afternoon. What say you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then the brass band in front of the Hotel
struck up the Dastur march in honour of the Sheikhs
who come to escort the Unionist Deputies and the
speaker to the Mosque.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have made up my mind. I have given my
word.&#8221;</p>
<p>And being called, Mrs. Gotfry, though loath to let
him go, presses his hand and wishes him good speed.</p>
<p>And here we are in the carriage on the right of the
green-turbaned Sheikh. We look disdainfully on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
troops, the brass band, and the crowd of nondescripts
that are leading the procession. We cross the bridge,
pass the Town-Hall, and, winding a narrow street
groaning with an electric tramway, we come to the
grand arcade in which the multitudes on both sides
are pressed against the walls and into the stalls by the
bullying Dragoons. We drive through until we
reach the arch, where some Khalif of the Omayiahs
used to take the air. And descending from the carriage,
we walk a few paces between two rows of book-shops,
and here we are in the court of the grand
Mosque Omayiah.</p>
<p>We elbow our way through the pressing, distressing
multitudes, following Ahmed Bey into the Mosque,
while the Army Officer mounts a platform in the
court and dispenses to the crowd there of his Turkish
blatherskite. We stand in the Mosque near the heavy
tapestried square which is said to be the sarcophagus
of St. John. Already a Sheikh is in the pulpit
preaching on the excellences of liberty, chopping out
definitions of equality, and quoting from Al-Hadith
to prove that all men are Allah&#8217;s children and that
the most favoured in Allah&#8217;s sight is he who is most
loving to his brother man. He then winds up with
an encomium on the heroes of the day, curses
vehemently the reactionaries and those who curse
them not (the Mosque resounds with &#8220;Curse the reactionists,
curse them all!&#8221;), tramples beneath his
heel every spy and informer of the New Era, invokes
the great Allah and his Apostle to watch over the
patriots and friends of the Ottoman nation, to visit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
with grievous punishment its enemies, and&ndash;&ndash;descends.</p>
<p>The silence of expectation ensues. The Mosque is
crowded; and the press of turbans is such that if a
pea were dropt from above it would not reach
the floor. From the pulpit the great Mohammedan
audience, with its red fezes, its green and white turbans,
seemed to Khalid like a verdant field overgrown
with daisies and poppies. &#8220;It is the beginning of
Arabia&#8217;s Spring, the resuscitation of the glory of
Islam,&#8221; and so forth; thus opening with a flourish of
flattery like the spouting tricksters whom he so
harshly judges. And what shall we say of him? It
were not fair quickly to condemn, to cry him down
at the start. Perhaps he was thus inspired by the
august assembly; perhaps he quailed and thought it
wise to follow thus far the advice of his friends. &#8220;It
was neither this nor that,&#8221; say our Scribe. &#8220;For as
he stood in the tribune, the picture of the field of
daisies and poppies suggested the picture of Spring.
A speaker is not always responsible for the frolics of
his fancy. Indeed, an audience of some five thousand
souls, all intent upon this opaque, mysterious Entity in
the tribune, is bound to reach the very heart of it;
for think what five thousand rays focussed on a sensitive
plate can do.&#8221; Thus our Scribe, apologetically.</p>
<p>But after the first contact and the vibrations of
enthusiasm and flattery that followed, Khalid regains
his equilibrium and reason, and strikes into his favourite
theme. He begins by arraigning the utilitarian
spirit of Europe, the rank materialism which is invading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
our very temples of worship. God, Truth,
Virtue, with them, is no longer esteemed for its own
worth, but for what it can yield of the necessities and
luxuries of life. And with these cynical materialistic
abominations they would be supreme even in the East;
they would extinguish with their dominating spirit of
trade every noble virtue of the soul. And yet, they
make presumption of introducing civilisation by benevolent
assimilation, rather dissimulation. For even
an Englishman in our country, for instance, is unlike
himself in his own. The American, too, who is loud-lunged
about democracy and shirt-sleeve diplomacy,
wheedles and truckles as good as the wiliest of our
pashas. And further he exclaims:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to Christian Europe as represented by the
State, therefore, or by the industrial powers of
wealth, or by the alluring charms of decadence in art
and literature, or by missionary and educational institutions,
would I have you turn for light and guidance.
No: from these plagues of civilisation protect us,
Allah! No: let us have nothing to do with that practical
Christianity which is become a sort of divine
key to Colonisation; a mint, as it were, which continually
replenishes the treasuries of Christendom.
Let us have nothing to do with their propagandas for
the propagation of supreme Fakes. No, no. Not
this Europe, O my Brothers, should we take for our
model or emulate: not the Europe which is being dereligionised
by Material Science; disorganised by
Communion and Anarchy; befuddled by Alcoholism;
enervated by Debauch. To another Europe indeed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
would I direct you&ndash;&ndash;a Europe, high, noble, healthy,
pure, and withal progressive. To the deep and inexhaustible
sources of genius there, of reason and wisdom
and truth, would I have you advert the mind.
The divine idealism of German philosophy, the lofty
purity of true French art, the strength and sterling
worth of English freedom,&ndash;&ndash;these we should try to
emulate; these we should introduce into the gorgeous
besottedness of Oriental life, and literature, and religion....&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus, until he reaches the heart of his subject;
while the field of daisies and poppies before him
gently sways as under a soft morning breeze; nods, as
it were, its approbation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;religion is purely a work
of the heart,&ndash;&ndash;the human heart, and the heart of the
world as well. For have not the three monotheistic
religions been born in this very heart of the world,
in Arabia, Syria, and Palestine? And are not our
Books of Revelation the truest guides of life hitherto
known to man? How then are we to keep this Heart
pure, to free it, in other words, from the plagues I
have named? And how, on the other hand, are we
to strengthen it, to quicken its sluggish blood? In a
word, how are we to attain to the pinnacle of health,
and religion, and freedom,&ndash;&ndash;of power, and love, and
light? By political revolutions, and insurrections,
and Dasturs? By blindly adopting the triple political
tradition of France, which after many years of
terror and bloodshed, only gave Europe a new Yoke,
a new Tyranny, a new grinding Machine? No, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
Brothers; not by political nomenclature, not by political
revolutions alone, shall the nations be emancipated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon Ahmed Bey begins to knit his brows;
Shakib shakes his head, biting his nether lip; and here
and there in the audience is heard a murmur about retrogression
and reaction. Khalid proceeds with his
allegory of the Muleteer and the Pack-Mule.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, the panel of the Mule is changed; the load,
too; and a few short-cuts are made in the rocky winding
road of statecraft and tyranny. Ah, the stolid,
patient, drudging Mule always exults in a new Panel,
which, indeed, seems necessary every decade, or so.
For the old one, when, from a sense of economy, or
from negligence or stupidity, is kept on for a length
of time, makes the back sore, and the Mule becomes
kickish and resty. Hence, the plasters of conservative
homeopathists, the operations suggested by political
leeches, the radical cures of social quacks, and such
like. But the Mule continues to kick against the
pricks; and the wise Muleteer, these days, when he
has not the price of a new Panel, or knows not how
to make one, sells him to the first bidder. And the
new owner thereupon washes the sores and wounds,
applies to them a salve of the patent kind, buys his
Mule a new Panel, and makes him do the work.
That is what I understand by a political revolution....
And are the Ottoman people free to-day?
Who in all Syria and Arabia dare openly criticise the
new Owner of the Mule?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ours in a sense is a theocratic Government. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
only by reforming the religion on which it is based,
is political reform in any way possible and enduring.&#8221;
And here he argues that the so-called Reformation of
Islam, of which Jelal ud-D&iuml;n el-Afghani and Mohammed
Abdu are the protagonists, is false. It is based on
theological juggling and traditional sophisms. Their
Al-Gazzali, whom they so much prize and quote, is
like the St. Augustine of the Christians: each of these
theologians finds in his own Book of Revelation a
divine criterion for measuring and judging all human
knowledge. No; a scientific truth can not be
measured by a Kor&acirc;nic epigram: the Kor&acirc;n, a divine
guide to life; a work of the heart should not attempt
to judge a work of the mind or should be judged
by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would brush the cobwebs of interpretation
and sophism from this Work of the heart,&#8221; he cries;
&#8220;every spider&#8217;s web in the Mosque, I would sweep
away. The garments of your religion, I would have
you clean, O my Brothers. Ay, even the threadbare
adventitious wrappages, I would throw away. From
the religiosity and cant of to-day I call you back to
the religion pure of the heart....&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Field of poppies and daisies begins to sway
as under a gale. It is swelling violently, tumultuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would free al-Islam,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;from its
degrading customs, its stupefying traditions, its enslaving
superstitions, its imbruting cants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here several voices in the audience order the
speaker to stop. &#8220;Innovation! Infidelity!&#8221; they cry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The yearly pestiferous consequences of the Haji&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;But
Khalid no longer can be heard. On all sides
zealotry raises and shakes a protesting hand; on all
sides it shrieks, objurgating, threatening. Here it
asks, &#8220;We would like to know if the speaker be a
Wahhabi.&#8221; From another part of the Mosque comes
the reply: &#8220;Ay, he is a Wahhabi.&#8221; And the voice
of the speaker thundering above the storm: &#8220;Only in
Wahhabism pure and simple is the reformation of al-Islam
possible.&#8221;... Finis.</p>
<p>Zealotry is set by the ear; the hornet&#8217;s nest is
stirred. Your field of poppies and daisies, O Khalid,
is miraculously transformed into a pit of furious grey
spectres and howling red spirits. And still you wait
in the tribune until the storm subside? Fool, fool!
Art now in a civilised assembly? Hast thou no eyes
to see, no ears to hear?</p>
<p>&#8220;Reactionist! Infidel! Innovator! Wahhabi!
Slay him! Kill him!&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Are these likely to subside
the while thou wait? By the tomb of St.
John there, get thee down, and quickly. Bravo,
Shakib!&ndash;&ndash;He rushes to the tribune, drags him down
by the jubbah, and, with the help of another friend,
hustles him out of the Mosque. But the thirst for
blood pursues them. And Khalid receives in the
court outside a stiletto-thrust in the back and a slash
in the forehead above the brow down to the ear.
Which, indeed, we consider a part of his good fortune.
Like the muleteer of his Lebanon tour, we
attribute his escape with two wounds to the prayers
of his good mother. For he is now in the carriage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
with Shakib, the blood streaming down his back and
over his face. With difficulty the driver makes his
way through the crowds, issues out of the arcade, and&ndash;&ndash;crack
the whip! Quickly to the Hotel.</p>
<p>The multitudes behind us, both inside and outside
the Mosque, are violently divided; for the real reactionists
of Damascus, those who are hostile to the
Constitution and the statochratic Government, are
always watching for an opportunity to give the match
to the dry sedges of sedition. And so, the liberals,
who are also the friends of Khalid, and the fanatical
mobs of the ulema, will have it out among themselves.
They call each other reactionists, plotters, conspirators;
and thereupon the bludgeons and poniards are
brandished; the pistols here and there are fired; the
Dragoons hasten to the scene of battle&ndash;&ndash;but we are
not writing now the History of the Ottoman Revolution.
We leave them to have it out among themselves
as best they can, and accompany our Khalid to
the Hotel.</p>
<p>Here the good Mrs. Gotfry washes the blood from
his face, and Shakib, after helping him to bed, hastens
to call the surgeon, who, having come straightway,
sews and dresses the wounds and assures us that they
are not dangerous. In the evening a number of
Sheikhs of an enlightened and generous strain, come
to inquire about him. They tell us that one of the
assailants of Khalid, a noted brigand, and ten of the
reactionists, are now in prison. The Society Deputies,
however, do not seem much concerned about their
wounded friend. Yes, they are concerned, but in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
another direction and on weightier matters. For the
telegraph wires on the following day were kept busy.
And in the afternoon of the second day after the
event, the man who helped Shakib to save Khalid from
the mob, comes to save Khalid&#8217;s life. The Superintendent
of the Telegraph himself is here to inform us
that Khalid was accused to the Military Tribunal as
a reactionist, and a cablegram, in which he is summoned
there, is just received.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had I delivered this to the Vali,&#8221; he continues,
&#8220;you would have been now in the hands of the police,
and to-morrow on your way to Constantinople. But
I shall not deliver it until you are safe out of the
City. And you must fly or abscond to-day, because I
can not delay the message until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Khalid and Shakib and Mrs. Gotfry take
counsel together. The one train for Baalbek leaves
in the morning; the carriage road is ruined from disuse;
and only on horseback can we fly. So, Mrs.
Gotfry orders her dragoman to hire horses for three,&ndash;&ndash;nay,
for four, since we must have an extra guide
with us,&ndash;&ndash;and a muleteer for the baggage.</p>
<p>And here Shakib interposes a suggestion: &#8220;They
must not come to the Hotel. Be with them on the
road, near the first bridge, about the first hour of
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the office of the Hotel the dragoman leaves word
that they are leaving for a friend&#8217;s house on account
of their patient.</p>
<p>And after dinner Mrs. Gotfry and Khalid set
forth afoot, accompanied by Shakib. In five minutes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
they reach the first bridge; the dragoman and the
guide, with their horses and lanterns, are there waiting.
Shakib helps Khalid to his horse and bids them
farewell. He will leave for Baalbek by the first
train, and be there ahead of them.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And now, Reader, were we really romancing, we
should here dilate of the lovely ride in the lovely
moonlight on the lovely road to Baalbek. But truth
to tell, the road is damnable, the welkin starless, the
night pitch-black, and our poor Dreamer is suffering
from his wounds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE STONING AND FLIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;And whence the subtle thrill of joy in suffering
for the Truth,&#8221; asks Khalid. &#8220;Whence the
light that flows from the wounds of martyrs? Whence
the rapture that triumphs over their pain? In the
thick of night, through the alcoves of the mountains,
over their barren peaks, down through the wadi of
oblivion, silently they pass. And they dream. They
dream of appearance in disappearance; of triumph in
surrender; of sunrises in the sunset.</p>
<p>&#8220;A mighty tidal wave leaves high upon the beach a
mark which later on becomes the general level of the
ocean. And so do the great thinkers of the world,&ndash;&ndash;the
poets and seers, the wise and strong and self-denying,
the proclaimers of the Religion of Man. And I
am but a scrub-oak in this forest of giants, my Brothers.
A scrub-oak which you might cut down, but not
uproot. Lop off my branches; apply the axe to my
trunk; make of my timber charcoal for the censers of
your temples of worship; but the roots of me are deep,
deep in the soil, beyond the reach of mortal hands.
They are even spreading under your tottering palaces
and temples....</p>
<p>&#8220;I dream of the awakening of the East; of puissant
Orient nations rising to glorify the Idea, to build temples
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
to the Universal Spirit&ndash;&ndash;to Art, and Love, and
Truth, and Faith. What if I am lost in the alcoves
of the hills, if I vanish forever in the night? The
sun that sets must rise. It is rising and lighting up
the dark and distant continents even when setting.
Think of that, ye who gloat over the sinking of my
mortal self.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; an idea is never too early annunciated. The
good seed will grow among the rocks, and though the
heavens withhold from it the sunshine and rain. It is
because I will it, nay, because a higher Will than mine
wills it, that the spirit of Khalid shall yet flow among
your pilgrim caravans, through the fertile deserts of
Arabia, down to the fountain-head of Faith, to Mecca
and Medina,&#8221; et cetera.</p>
<p>This, perhaps the last of the rhapsodies of Khalid&#8217;s,
the Reader considering the circumstances under which
it was written, will no doubt condone. Further, however,
in the K. L. MS. we can not now proceed. Certainly
the Author is not wanting in the sort of courage
which is loud-lunged behind the writing table; his
sufficiency of spirit is remarkable, unutterable. But
we would he knew that the strong do not exult in their
strength, nor the wise in their wisdom. For to fly
and philosophize were one thing, and to philosophize
in prison were another. Khalid this time does not follow
closely in the way of the Masters. But he would
have done so, if we can believe Shakib in this, had not
Mrs. Gotfry persuaded him to the contrary. He
would have stood in the Turkish Areopagus at Constantinople,
defended himself somewhat Socratic before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
his judges, and hung out his tung on a rickety gibbet
in the neighborhood of St. Sophia. But Mrs. Gotfry
spoiled his great chance. She cheated him of the
glory of dying for a noble cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Turks are not worth the sacrifice,&#8221; Shakib
heard her say, when Khalid ejaculated somewhat about
martyrdom. And when she offered to accompany
him, the flight did not seem shameful in his eyes.
Nay, it became necessary; and under the circumstances
it was, indeed, cowardice not to fly. For is it not as
noble to surrender one&#8217;s self to Love as to the Turks
or any other earthly despotism? Gladly, heroically, he
adventures forth, therefore, and philosophizes on the
way about the light that flows from the wounds of
persecution. But we regret that this celestial stream
is not unmixed; it is accompanied by blood and pus;
by distention and fever, and other inward and outward
sores.</p>
<p>In this grievous state, somewhat like Don Quixote
after the Battle of the Mill, our Khalid enters Baalbek.
If the reader likes the comparison between the
two Knights at this juncture, he must work it out for
himself. We can not be so uncharitable as that; especially
that our Knight is a compatriot, and is now,
after our weary journeyings together, become our
friend.&ndash;&ndash;Our poor grievous friend who must submit
again to the surgeon&#8217;s knife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gotfry would not let him go to his mother,
for she herself would nurse him. So, the doctor is
called to the Hotel. And after opening, disinfecting,
and dressing the wounds, he orders his patient to keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
in bed for some days. They will then visit the ruins
and resume their journeying to Egypt. Khalid no
longer would live in Syria,&ndash;&ndash;in a country forever
doomed to be under the Turkish yoke, faring, nay,
misfaring alike in the New Era as in the Old.</p>
<p>Now, his mother, tottering with age and sorrow,
comes to the Hotel, and begs him in a flood of tears
to come home; for his father is now with the Jesuits of
Beirut and seldom comes to Baalbek. And his
cousin Najma, with a babe on her arm and a tale of
woe in her eyes, comes also to invite her cousin Khalid
to her house.</p>
<p>She is alone; her father died some months ago; her
husband, after the dethronement of Abd&#8217;ul-Hamid, being
implicated in the reaction-movement, fled the country;
and his relatives, to add to her affliction, would
deprive her of her child. She is alone; and sick in
the lungs. She coughs, too, the same sharp, dry, malignant
cough that once plagued Khalid. Ay, the same
disease which he buried in the pine forest of Mt. Lebanon,
he beholds the ghost of it now, more terrible and
heart-rending than anything he has yet seen or experienced.
The disease which he conquered is come
back in the person of his cousin Najma to conquer him.
And who can assure Khalid that it did not steal into
her breast along with his kisses? And yet, he is not
the only one in Baalbek who returned from America
with phthisis. O, but that thought is horrifying. Impossible&ndash;&ndash;he
can not believe it.</p>
<p>But whether it be from you or from another, O Khalid,
there is the ghost of it beckoning to you. Look at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
it. Are those the cheeks, those the eyes, this the body
which a year ago was a model of rural charm and
beauty and health? Is this the compensation of love?
Is there anything like it dreamt of in your philosophy?
There she is, who once in the ruined Temple of Venus
mixed the pomegranate flower of her cheeks with the
saffron of thy sickly lips. Wasted and dejected broken
in body and spirit, she sits by your bedside nursing her
baby and coughing all the while. And that fixed expression
of sadness, so habitual among the Arab women
who carry their punks and their children on their backs
and go a-begging, it seems as if it were an hundred
autumns old, this sadness. But right there, only a year
ago, the crimson poppies dallied with the laughing
breeze; the melting rubies dilated of health and joy.</p>
<p>And now, deploring, imploring, she asks: &#8220;Will
you not come to me, O Khalid? Will you not let me
nurse you? Come; and your mother, too, will live
with us. I am so lonesome, so miserable. And at
night the boys cast stones at my door. My husband&#8217;s
relatives put them to it because I would not give them
the child. And they circulate all kinds of calumnies
about me too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khalid promises to come, and assures her that she
will not long remain alone. &#8220;And Allah willing,&#8221; he
adds, &#8220;you will recover and be happy again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rises to go, when Mrs. Gotfry enters the room.
Khalid introduces his cousin as his dead bride. &#8220;What
do you mean?&#8221; she inquires. He promises to explain.
Meanwhile, she goes to her room, brings some <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'sweet-meats' across lines">sweetmeats</ins>
in a round box inlaid with mother-of-pearl for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
Khalid&#8217;s guests. And taking the babe in her arms,
she fondles and kisses it, and gives its mother some advice
about suckling. &#8220;Not whenever the child cries,
but only at stated times,&#8221; she repeats.</p>
<p>So much about Khalid&#8217;s mother and cousin. A few
days after, when he is able to leave his room, he goes
to see them. His cousin Najma he would take with
him to Cairo. He would not leave her behind, a prey
to the cruelty of loneliness and disease. He tells her
this. She is overjoyed. She is ready to go whenever
he says. To-morrow? Please Allah, yes. But&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Please Allah, ill-luck is following. For on his
way back to the Hotel, a knot of boys, lying in
wait in one of the side streets, cast stones at him.
He looks back, and a missile whizzes above his head,
another hits him in the forehead almost undoing the
doctor&#8217;s work. Alas, that wound! Will it ever
heal? Khalid takes shelter in one of the shops; a
cameleer rates the boys and chases them away. The
stoning was repeated the following day, and the
cause of it, Shakib tells us, is patent. For when it
became known in Baalbek that Khalid, the excommunicated
one, is living in the Hotel, and with an
American woman! the old prejudices against him were
aroused, the old enemies were astirring. The priests
held up their hands in horror; the women wagged
their long tongues in the puddle of scandal; and the
most fanatical shrieked out, execrating, vituperating,
threatening even the respectable Shakib, who persists
in befriending this muleteer&#8217;s son. Excommunicated,
he now comes with this Americaniyah (American
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
woman) to corrupt the community. Horrible! We
will even go farther than this boy&#8217;s play of stoning.
We present petitions to the kaiemkam demanding the
expulsion of this Khalid from the Hotel, from the
City.</p>
<p>From other quarters, however, come heavier charges
against Khalid. The Government of Damascus has
not been idle ever since the seditious lack-beard Sheikh
disappeared. The telegraph wires, in all the principal
cities of Syria, are vibrating with inquiries about him,
with orders for his arrest. One such the kaiemkam
of Baalbek had just received when the petition of the
&#8220;Guardians of the Morals of the Community&#8221; was
presented to him. To this, the kaiemkam, in a perfunctory
manner, applies his seal, and assures his petitioners
that it will promptly be turned over to the
proper official. But Turk as Turks go, he &#8220;places
it under the cushion,&#8221; when they leave. Which expression,
translated into English means, he quashes it.</p>
<p>Now, by good chance, this is the same kaiemkam who
sent Khalid a year ago to prison, maugre the efforts
and importunities and other inducements of Shakib.
And this time, he will do him and his friend a good
turn. He was thinking of the many misfortunes of
this Khalid, and nursing a little pity for him, when
Shakib entered to offer a written complaint against a
few of the more noted instigators of the assailants of
his friend. His Excellency puts this in his pocket and
withdraws with Shakib into another room. A few
minutes after, Shakib was hurrying to the Hotel to
confer with his brother Khalid and Mrs. Gotfry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the Order with these very eyes,&#8221; said Shakib,
almost poking his two forefingers into them.
&#8220;The kaiemkam showed it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hence, the secret preparations inside the Hotel and
out of it for a second remove, for a final flight.
Shakib packs up; Najma is all ready. And Khalid
cuts his hair, doffs his jubbah, and appears again in
the ordinary attire of civilised mortals. For how else
can he get out of Beirut and the telegraph wires
throughout Syria are flowing with orders for his arrest?
In a hat and frock-coat, therefore (furnished
by Shakib), he enters into the carriage with Mrs. Gotfry
about two hours after midnight; and, with their
whole retinue, make for Riak, and thence by train for
Beirut. Here Shakib obtains passports for himself
and Najma, and together with Mrs. Gotfry and her
dragoman, they board in the afternoon the Austrian
Liner for Port-Said; while, in the evening, walking at
the side of one of the boatmen, Khalid, passportless,
stealthily passes through the port, and rejoins his
friends.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_X_THE_DESERT' id='CHAPTER_X_THE_DESERT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE DESERT</h3>
</div>
<p>We remember seeing once a lithographic print
representing a Christmas legend of the Middle
Ages, in which a detachment of the Heavenly Host&ndash;&ndash;big,
ugly, wild-looking angels&ndash;&ndash;are pursuing, with
sword and pike, a group of terror-stricken little devils.
The idea in the picture produced such an impression
that one wished to see the helpless, pitiful imps in
heaven and the armed winged furies, their pursuers, in
the other place. Now, as we go through the many
pages of Shakib&#8217;s, in which he dilates of the mischances,
the persecutions, and the flights of Khalid,
and of which we have given an abstract, very brief
but comprehensive, in the preceding Chapters, we are
struck with the similarity in one sense between his
Dastur-legend, so to speak, and that of the Middle
Ages to which we have alluded. The devils in both
pictures are distressing, pitiful; while the winged persecutors
are horribly muscular, and withal atrociously
armed.</p>
<p>Indeed, this legend of the Turkish angels of Fraternity
and Equality, pursuing the Turkish little devils
of reaction, so called, is most killing. But we can
not see how the descendants of Yakut and Seljuk
Khan, whether pursuers or pursued, whether Dastur
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
winged furies they be, or Hamidian devils, are going to
hold their own in face of the fell Dragon which soon or
late must overtake them. That heavy, slow-going,
slow-thinking Monster&ndash;&ndash;and it makes little difference
whether he comes from the North or from the West&ndash;&ndash;will
wait until the contending parties exhaust their
strength and then&ndash;&ndash;but this is not our subject. We
would that this pursuing business cease on all sides,
and that everybody of all parties concerned pursue
rather, and destroy, the big strong devil within them.
Thus sayeth the preacher. And thus, for once, we,
too. For does not every one of these furious angels
of Equality, whether in Constantinople, in Berlin, in
Paris, in London, or in New York, sit on his wings
and reveal his horns when he rises to power? We
are tired of wings that are really nothing but horns,
misshaped and misplaced.</p>
<p>Look at our French-swearing, whiskey-drinking
Tataric angels of the Dastur! Indeed, we rejoice
that our poor little Devil is now beyond the reach of
their dripping steel and rickety second-hand gibbets.
And yet, not very far; for if the British Government
consent or blink, Khalid and many real reactionists
whom Cairo harbours, would have to seek an asylum
elsewhere. And the third flight might not be as successful
as the others. But none such is necessary.
On the sands of the Libyan desert, not far from
Cairo and within wind of Helwan, they pitch their
tents. And Mrs. Gotfry is staying at Al-Hayat,
which is a stone&#8217;s throw from their evening fire. She
would have Khalid live there too, but he refuses. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
will live with his cousin and Shakib for a while. He
is captivated, we are told, by that little cherub of a
babe. But this does not prevent him from visiting
his friend the Buhaist Priestess every day and dining
often with her at the Hotel.</p>
<p>She, too, not infrequently comes to the camp. Indeed,
finding the solitude agreeable she has a tent
pitched near theirs. And as a relief from the noise
and bustle of tourists and the fatiguing formalities of
Hotel life, she repairs thither for a few days every
week.</p>
<p>Now, in this austere delicacy of the desert, where
allwhere is the softness of pure sand, Khalid is perfectly
happy. Never did he seem so careless, our
Scribe asserts, and so jovial and child-like in his joys.
Far from the noise and strife of politics, far from the
bewildering tangle of thought, far from the vain hopes
and dreams and ambitions of life, he lives each day as
if it were the last of the world. Here are joys manifold
for a weary and persecuted spirit: the joy of
having your dearest friend and comrade with you;
the joy of nursing and helping to restore to health and
happiness the woman dearest to your heart; the joy
of a Love budding in beauty and profusion; and&ndash;&ndash;this,
the rarest and sublimest for Khalid&ndash;&ndash;the joy
of worshipping at the cradle&ndash;&ndash;of fondling, caressing,
and bringing up one of the brightest, sweetest, loveliest
of babes.</p>
<p>Najib is his name&ndash;&ndash;it were cruel to neutralise such
a prodigy&ndash;&ndash;and he is just learning to walk and lisp.
Khalid teaches him the first step and the first monosyllable,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
receiving in return the first kiss which his infant
lips could voice. With what joy Najib makes
his first ten steps! With what zest would he practise
on the soft sands, laughing as he falls, and rising
to try again. And thus, does he quickly, wonderfully
develop, unfolding in the little circle of his caressers&ndash;&ndash;in
his mother&#8217;s lap, in Shakib&#8217;s arms, on Khalid&#8217;s
back, on Mrs. Gotfry&#8217;s knee&ndash;&ndash;the irresistible charm
of his precocious spirit.</p>
<p>In two months of desert life, Najib could run on
the sands and sit down when tired to rest; in two
months he could imitate in voice and gesture whatever
he heard or saw: the donkey&#8217;s bray, and with a
tilt of the head like him; the cry of the cock; the
shrill whistle of the train; and the howling of donkey
boys. His keen sense of discrimination in sounds is
incredible. And one day, seeing a Mohammedan
spreading his rug to pray, he begins to kneel and kiss
the ground in imitation of him. He even went into
the tent and brought Khalid&#8217;s jubbah to spread it on
the sand likewise for that purpose. So sensitive to
outside impressions is this child that he quickly responds
to the least suggestion and with the least effort.
Early in the morning, when the chill of night is still
on the sands, he toddles into Khalid&#8217;s tent cooing and
warbling his joy. A walking jasmine flower, a singing
ray of sunshine, Khalid calls him. And the
mother, on seeing her child thus develop, begins to
recuperate. In this little garden of happiness, her
hope begins to blossom.</p>
<p>But Khalid would like to know why Najib, on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
coming into his tent in the morning and seeing him
naked, always pointed with his little finger and with
questioning smile, to what protruded under the navel.
The like questions Khalid puts with the ease and
freedom of a child. And writes full pages about
them, too, in which he only succeeds in bamboozling
himself and us. For how can we account for everything
a child does? Even the psychologist with his
reflex-action theory does not solve the whole problem.
But Khalid would like to know&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps not
so innocently does he dwell upon this subject as upon
others&ndash;&ndash;he would like to know the significance of
Najib&#8217;s pointed finger and smile. It may be only an
accident, Khalid. &#8220;But an accident,&#8221; says he, &#8220;occurring
again and again in the same manner under
stated conditions ceases to be such.&#8221; And might not
the child, who is such an early and keen observer,
have previously seen his mother in native buff, and
was surprised to see that appendage in you, Khalid?</p>
<p>Even at Al-Hayat Najib is become popular. Khalid
often comes here carrying him on his back. And
how ready is the child to salaam everybody, and with
both hands, as he stands on the veranda steps.
&#8220;Surely,&#8221; says Khalid, &#8220;there is a deeper understanding
between man and child than between man
and man. For who but a child dare act so freely
among these polyglots of ceremony in this little world
of frills and frocks and feathers? Who but a child
dare approach without an introduction any one of these
solemn-looking tourists? Here then is the divine
source of the sweetest and purest joy. Here is that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
one touch of Nature which makes the whole world
kin. For the child, and though he be of the lowest
desert tribe, standing on the veranda of a fashionable
Hotel, can warm and sweeten with the divine flame
that is in him, the hearts of these sour-seeming, stiff-looking
tourists who are from all corners of the earth.
Is not this a miracle? My professor of psychology
will say, &#8216;Nay.&#8217; But what makes the heart leap in
that grave and portly gentleman, who might be from
Finland or Iceland, for all I know, when Najib&#8217;s
hand is raised to him in salutation? What makes
that stately and sombre-looking dame open her arms,
when Najib plucks a flower and, after smelling it,
presents it to her? What makes that reticent, meditative,
hard-favoured ancient, who is I believe a psychologist,
what makes him so interested in observing Najib
when he stands near the piano pointing anxiously to
the keyboard? For the child enjoys not every kind
of music: play a march or a melody and he will keep
time, listing joyously from side to side and waving
his hand in an arch like a maestro; play something
insipid or chaotic and he will stand there impassive
as a <ins class="trchange" title="Added closing double-quote">statue.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>And &#8220;the reticent hard-favoured ancient,&#8221; who turns
out to be an American professor of some ology, explains
to Khalid why lively music moves children,
while soft and subtle tones do not. But Khalid is
not open to argument on the subject. He prefers
to believe that children, especially when so keenly
sensitive as his prodigy, understand as much, if not
more, about music as the average operagoer of to-day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
But that is not saying much. The professor furthermore,
while admitting the extreme precocity of
Najib&#8217;s mind, tries to simplify by scientific analysis
what to Khalid and other laymen seemed wonderful,
almost miraculous. Here, too, Khalid botches the
arguments of the learned gentleman in his effort to
give us a summary of them, and tells us in the end
that never after, so long as that professor was there,
did he ever visit Al-Hayat.</p>
<p>He prefers to frolic and philosophise with his
prodigy on the sands. He goes on all four around
the tent, carrying Najib on his back; he digs a little
ditch in the sand and teaches him how to lie therein.
Following the precept of the Greek philosophers, he
would show him even so early how to die. And
Najib lies in the sand-grave, folds his hands on his
breast and closes his eyes. Rising therefrom, Khalid
would teach him how to dance like a dervish, and
Najib whirls and whirls until he falls again in that
grave.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Gotfry came that day, Khalid asked
the child to show her how to dance and die, and
Najib begins to whirl like a dervish until he falls
in the grave; thereupon he folds his arms, closes his
eyes, and smiles a pathetic smile. This by far is the
masterpiece of all his feats. And one evening, when
he was repeating this strange and weird antic, which
in Khalid&#8217;s strange mind might be made to symbolise
something stranger than both, he saw, as he lay in
the grave, a star in the sky. It was the first time he
saw a star; and he jumped out of his sand-grave exulting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
in the discovery he had made. He runs to
his mother and points the star to her....</p>
<p>And thus did Khalid spend his halcyon months in
the desert. Here was an arcadia, perfect but brief.
For his delight in infant worship, and in the new
Love which was budding in beauty and profusion, and
in tending his sick cousin who was recovering her
health, and in the walks around the ruins in the
desert with his dearest comrade and friend,&ndash;&ndash;these,
alas, were joys of too pure a nature to endure.

<h2>AL-KHATIMAH</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;But I can not see all that you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do not love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back again to Swedenborg&ndash;&ndash;I told you more
than once that he is not my apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor is he mine. But he has expressed a great
truth, Jam&iuml;lah. Now, can you love me in the light of
that truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are always asking me that same question, Khalid.
You do not understand me. I do not believe in
marriage. I tried it once; I will not try it again.
I am married to Buhaism. And you Khalid&ndash;&ndash;remember
my words&ndash;&ndash;you will yet be an apostle&ndash;&ndash;the
apostle&ndash;&ndash;of Buhaism. And you will find me with
you, whether you be in Arabia, in America, or in
Egypt. I feel this&ndash;&ndash;I know it&ndash;&ndash;I am positive
about it. Your star and mine are one. We are
born under the same star. We are now in the same
orbit, approaching the same nadir. We are ruled by
our stars. I believe this, and you don&#8217;t. At least,
you say you don&#8217;t. But you do. You don&#8217;t know
your own mind. The trend of the current of your
life is beyond your grasp, beyond your comprehension.
I know. And you must listen to me. You must
follow my advice. If you can not come with me now
to the States, you will await me here. I am called
on a pressing business. And within three months,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
at the most, I shall return and find you waiting for
me right here, in this desert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not try to understand me? Can you not
find in my ideas the very essence of Buhaism? Can
you not come up to my height and behold there the
star that you have taken for your guide? My Truth,
Jam&iuml;lah, can you not see that? Love and Faith, free
from all sectarianism and all earthly authority,&ndash;&ndash;what
is Buhaism or Mohammedanism or Christianity
beside them? Moreover, I have a mission. And to
love me you must believe in <i>me</i>, not in the Buha.
You laugh at my dream. But one day it will be
realised. A great Arab Empire in the border-land
of the Orient and Occident, in this very heart of
the world, this Arabia, this Egypt, this Field of the
Cloth of Gold, so to speak, where the Male and
Female of the Spirit shall give birth to a unifying
faith, a unifying art, a unifying truth&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vagaries, chimeras,&#8221; interrupted Mrs. Gotfry.
&#8220;Buhaism is established, and it needs a great apostle.
It needs you; it will have you. I will have you.
Your destiny is interwoven with mine. You can
not flee it, do what you may. We are ruled by our
stars, Khalid. And if you do not realise this now,
you will realise it to-morrow. Here, give me your
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then. Good-bye&ndash;&ndash;<i>au revoir</i>. In
three months you will change your mind. In three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
months I will return to the East and find you waiting
for me, even here in this desert. Think on it, and
take care of yourself. <i>Au revoir.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>In this strange, mysterious manner, after pacing
for hours on the sand in the sheen of the full moon,
Mrs. Gotfry says farewell to Khalid.</p>
<p>He sits on a rock near his tent and ponders for
hours. He seeks in the stars, as it were, a clue to
the love of this woman, which he first thought to be
unfathomable. There it is, the stars seem to say.
And he looks into the sand-grave near him, where
little Najib practises how to die. Yes; a fitting
symbol of the life and love called modern, boasting
of freedom. They dance their dervish dance, these
people, even like Khalid&#8217;s little Najib, and fall into
their sand-graves, and fold their arms and smile:
&#8220;We are in love&ndash;&ndash;or we are out of it.&#8221; Which is
the same. No: he&#8217;ll have none of this. A heart as
simple as this desert sand, as deep in affection as this
heaven, untainted by the uncertainties and doubts and
caprices of modern life,&ndash;&ndash;only in such a heart is the
love that endures, the love divine and eternal.</p>
<p>He goes into Najma&#8217;s tent. The mother and her
child are sound asleep. He stands between the bed
and the cot contemplating the simplicity and innocence
and truth, which are more eloquent in Najib&#8217;s
brow than aught of human speech. His little hand
raised above his head seems to point to a star which
could be seen through an opening in the canvas. Was
it his star&ndash;&ndash;the star that he saw in the sand-grave&ndash;&ndash;the
star that is calling to him?&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></p>
<p>But let us resume our narration.</p>
<p>A fortnight after Mrs. Gotfry&#8217;s departure Shakib
leaves the camp to live in Cairo. He is now become
poet-laureate to one of the big pashas.</p>
<p>Khalid is left alone with Najma and Najib.</p>
<p>And one day, when they are playing a game of
&#8220;donkey,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Khalid carried Najib on his back, ran
on all four around the tent, and Najma was the donkey-driver,&ndash;&ndash;the
child of a sudden utters a shriek and
falls on the sand. He is in convulsions; and after the
relaxation, lo, his right hand is palsied, his mouth
awry, and his eyes a-squint. Khalid finds a young
doctor at Al-Hayat, and his diagnosis of the case does
not disturb the mind. It is infantile paralysis, a disease
common with delicate children. And the doctor, who
is of a kind and demonstrative humour, discourses at
length on the disease, speaks of many worse cases of
its kind he cured, and assures the mother that within
a month the child will recover. For the present he
can but prescribe a purgative and a massage of the
arm and spine. On the third visit, he examines the
child&#8217;s f&aelig;ces and is happy to have discovered the seat
and cause of the affection. The liver is not performing
its function; and given such weak nerves as the
child&#8217;s, a torpid liver in certain cases will produce
paralysis.</p>
<p>But Khalid is not satisfied with this. He places
the doctor&#8217;s prescription in his pocket, and goes down
to Cairo for a specialist. He comes, this one, to disturb
their peace of mind with his indecision. It is
not infantile paralysis, and he can not yet say what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
it is. Khalid meanwhile is poring over medical books
on all the diseases that children are heir to.</p>
<p>On the fifth day the child falls again in convulsions,
and the left arm, too, is paralysed. They take him
down to Cairo; and Medicine, considering the disease
of his mother, guesses a third time&ndash;&ndash;tuberculosis of
the spine, it says&ndash;&ndash;and guesses wrong. Again, considering
the strabismus, the obliquity of the mouth,
the palsy in the arms, and the convulsions, we guess
closely, but ominously. Nay, Medicine is positive
this time; for a fifth and a sixth Guesser confirm the
others. Here we have a case of cerebral meningitis.
That is certain; that is fatal.</p>
<p>Najib is placed under treatment. They cut his
hair, his beautiful flow of dark hair; rub his scalp
with chloroform; keep the hot bottles around his
feet, the ice bag on his head; and give him a spoon
of physic every hour. &#8220;Make no noise around the
room, and admit no light into it,&#8221; further advises the
doctor. Thus for two weeks the child languishes in
his mother&#8217;s arms; and resting from the convulsions
and the coma, he would fix on Khalid the hollow,
icy glance of death. No; the light and intelligence
might never revisit those vacant eyes.</p>
<p>Now Shakib comes to suggest a consultation. The
great English physician of Cairo, why not call <i>him</i>?
It might not be meningitis, after all, and the child
might be helped, might be cured.</p>
<p>The great guesswork Celebrity is called. He examines
the patient and confirms the opinion of his
confr&egrave;res, rather his disciples.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But the whole tissue,&#8221; he continues with glib
assurance, &#8220;is not affected. The area is local, and to
the side of the ear that is sore. The strabismus being
to the right, the affection must be to the left. And
the pus accumulating behind the ear, under the bone,
and pressing on the covering of the brain, produces
the inflammation. Yes, pus is the cause of this.&#8221; And
he repeats the Arabic proverb in broken Arabic, &#8220;A
drop of pus will disable a camel.&#8221; Further, &#8220;Yes,
the child&#8217;s life can be saved by trepanning. It should
have been done already, but the time&#8217;s not passed.
Let the surgeon come and make a little opening&ndash;&ndash;no;
a child can stand chloroform better than an adult.
And when the pus is out he will be well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a private consultation the disciples beg to observe
that there was no evidence of pus behind the ear.
&#8220;It is beneath the skullbone,&#8221; the Master asserts.
And so we decide upon the operation. The Eye
and Ear specialist is called, and after weighing the
probabilities of the case and considering that the great
Celebrity had said there was pus, although there be
no evidence of it, he convinces Khalid that if the
child is not benefited by the operation he cannot suffer
from it more than he is suffering now.</p>
<p>The surgeon comes with his assistants. Little
Najib is laid on the table; the chloroform towel is
applied; the scalpels, the cotton, the basins of hot water,
and other accessories, are handed over by one doctor
to another. The Cutter begins. Shakib is there
watching with the rest; Najma is in an adjacent room
weeping; and Khalid is pacing up and down the hall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
his brows moistened with the cold sweat of anguish
and suspense.</p>
<p>No pus between the scalp and the bone: the little
hammer and chisel are handed to the Cutter. One,
two, three,&ndash;&ndash;the child utters a faint cry; the chloroform
towel is applied again;&ndash;&ndash;four, five, six, and the
seventh stroke of the little hammer opens the skull.
The Cutter then penetrates with his catheter, searches
thoroughly through the brain&ndash;&ndash;here&ndash;&ndash;there&ndash;&ndash;above&ndash;&ndash;below&ndash;&ndash;and
finally holds the instrument up to
his assistants to show them that there is&ndash;&ndash;no pus!
&#8220;If there be any,&#8221; says he, &#8220;it is beyond the reach
of surgery.&#8221; The wound, therefore, is quickly
washed, sewn up, and dressed, while everybody is
wondering how the great Celebrity can be
wrong....</p>
<p>Little Najib remains under the influence of an&aelig;sthetics
for two days&ndash;&ndash;for two days he is in a trance.
And on the third, the fever mounts to the danger line
and descends again&ndash;&ndash;only after he had stretched his
little arm and breathed his last!</p>
<p>And Khalid and Najma and Shakib take him out
to the desert and bury him in the sand, near the
tent round which he used to play. There, where he
stepped his first step, lisped his first syllable, smacked
his first kiss, and saw for the first time a star in the
heaven, he is laid; he is given to the Night, to the
Eternity which Khalid does not fear. And yet, what
tears, Shakib tells us, he shed over that little grave.</p>
<p>But about the time the second calamity approaches,
when Najma begins to decline and waste away from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
grief, when the relapse sets in and carries her in a
fortnight downward to the grave of her child,
Khalid&#8217;s eyes are as two pieces of flint stone on a
sheet of glass. His tears flow inwardly, as it were,
through his cracked heart....</p>
<p>Like the poet Saadi, Khalid once sought to fill his
lap with celestial flowers for his friends and brothers;
and he gathered some; but, alas, the fragrance of them
so intoxicated him that the skirt dropt from his
hand....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>We are again at the Mena House, where we first
met Shakib. And the reader will remember that the
tears rushed to his eyes when we inquired of him
about his Master and Friend. &#8220;He has disappeared
some ten days ago,&#8221; he then said, &#8220;and I know not
whither.&#8221; Therefore, ask us not, O gentle Reader,
what became of him. How can <i>we</i> know? He
might have entered a higher spiritual circle or a
lower; of a truth, he is not now on the outskirts of
the desert: deeper to this side or to that he must have
passed. And passing he continues to dream of &#8220;appearance
in the disappearance; of truth in the surrender;
of sunrises in the sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, fare <i>thee</i> well in either case, Reader. And
whether well or ill spent the time we have journeyed
together, let us not quarrel about it. For our part,
we repeat the farewell words of Sheikh Taleb of
Damascus: &#8220;Judge us not severely.&#8221; And if we did
not study to entertain thee as other Scribes do, it is
because we consider thee, dear good Reader, above

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
